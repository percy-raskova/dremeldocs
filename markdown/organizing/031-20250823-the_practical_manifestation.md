# the practical manifestation

Transitioning is the practical manifestation of gender abolition. The more freely transitioning is integrated into the social fabric, the less impactful gender is as a construct (and vice versa). https://t.co/8iAGCkjQ0C The societal phase change from gender-solid to gender-liquid necessarily presents as an increasing mass of gender-particles (individual people) melting and moving through the medium (transitioning). Even if a particular particle is only mobile temporarily before refreezing elsewhere, the collective motion of ALL particles is what marks the transition to liquid state.
