# *comedian voice

*comedian voice* what's the DEAL with ideology being rooted in class interest??? https://t.co/33sfAwzhVe (also the "super far left on everything" you're noticing is not rooted in a revolutionary framework, it's just an aesthetic of radicalism and progressivism that self-styled "free thinkers" enjoy draping themselves in without taking the leap of class-suicidal revolution-building.)
