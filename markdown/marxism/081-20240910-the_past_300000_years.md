# the past 300,000 years

Not only have humans evolved plenty in the past 300,000 years, different subpopulations have and continue to evolve rather recently. One notable example is lactase persistence, which evolved among pastoralist populations within the last 10,000 years. https://t.co/vmzl4jS62g Another example is amylase, an enzyme that digests starch. Many animals produce various kinds of amylase, including salivary amylase (AMY1) in humans. Our closest primate relatives typical have 0 or 1 copies of AMY1, while humans have multiple copies. The number of AMY1 copies -- which correlates with the amount of amylase actually present in saliva -- is highly variable among human populations, with the historically more starch-dependent agricultural populations having many more copies. Again, this is very recent evolution.
