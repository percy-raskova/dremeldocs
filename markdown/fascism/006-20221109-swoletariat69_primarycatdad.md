# @swoletariat69 @primarycatdad

@swoletariat69 @primarycatdad That's what I see as the failure of western Maoists. Insufficient analysis of cultural context, giving rise to the notion that fighting--in and of itself--is how you build mass support. If you haven't done the groundwork, it's actually the opposite. @swoletariat69 @primarycatdad And the failure of the NON-Maoists is, of course, what you laid out earlier. The belief that having your eyes on the prize is actually a bad thing, and we should just ask politely for the arms of power to be handed over to us.
