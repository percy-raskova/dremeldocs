# my irreparably Zionist family

Spending "Thanksgiving" continuing to ghost my irreparably Zionist family, hanging out with a sweet, elderly puppy, and not celebrating genocide. I don't think there's any sort of moral "sin" associated with taking the opportunity to chill with your family today. But not if their entire identity is genocide.
