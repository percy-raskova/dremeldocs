# make spaces accessible

People reeeeally need to stop referring to masking as something to "make spaces accessible" or "protect disabled people."

Imagine an anti-drunk driving campaign that revolved around making highways "inclusive."

Always drive sober, regardless of who else is on the road. It shouldn't be a heavy lift to convince "socialists" of the material dangers of drunk driving, to the point of needing to appeal to their (frankly underwhelming) sense of justice.

Although I guess there isn't a hegemonic narrative that drunk driving magically disappeared ðŸ¤”
