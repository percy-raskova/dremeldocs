# Oversimplified illustration

@mercurial_moons Oversimplified illustration:

Every water molecule is like a tiny magnet. Microwave ovens use electricity to make little "blasts of magnetism" that, when they touch the water magnets, force them to align. Then the microwave sends an opposite direction magnet wave, flipping them. @mercurial_moons Flipping over and over like that makes the water get hot, like you would if you were forced to keep running back and forth. And hot water molecules heat other molecules in the food.

This is why frozen food doesn't microwave well: the ice molecules won't flip untill they melt.
