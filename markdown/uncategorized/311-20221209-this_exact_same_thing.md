# this exact same thing

@disnazzio I struggled with this exact same thing. People tried to """help""" by saying "You're not some special case, the one and only example of objective evil in this world."

Like. How dare you. I *could* be a literal demon! @disnazzio What did help was internalizing the notion that the very fact that I was so preoccupied with how "evil" I "obviously am" meant that I couldn't truly be evil. Evil people don't drive themselves crazy worrying about how evil they are.
