# clean Wehrmacht

Franz Halder helped plan the invasions of Poland, Western Europe, and the USSR, was later recruited by the US to help craft the myth of the "clean Wehrmacht."  His own war diary tells a different story. They were already looking to "clean house" mere weeks into the invasion. https://t.co/TM1RwAGrqs https://t.co/cudsB2rulc Fun fact: Halder is also the only general to ever be given an award by both Hitler and a US president!
