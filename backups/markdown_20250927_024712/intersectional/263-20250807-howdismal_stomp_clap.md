# howdismal Stomp Clap

I'm glad people are talking about howdismal Stomp Clap Hey was as a cultural moment. But it's time to look to the future.

I propose a new genre that I'm calling Blastfare. Big brassy bands, driving drumlines, electric guitar riffs, and inspirational, politically-incisive lyrics. Imagine big band mixed with power metal mixed with OG hip-hop. The fanfare of horns and marching drums, rhythmic and powerful. Piercing, complex wails of guitar. Unapologetically confrontational lyrical and musical themes that get you in the mood to rise up and topple regimes.
