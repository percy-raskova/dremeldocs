# precarious white people

They're not interested in replacing precarious immigrants with precarious white people. That doesn't even make sense. All that matters to them is superexploitation and the maintenance of hegemony. https://t.co/fi9OFXbTHz They want precarious segments to become *more* precarious -- hence more criminalization of existing populations. And they want to *expand* the exploitable segment of the population, hence expanding the criminalization to apply to new segments. And most of all, they want to tighten the reins of hegemony to regiment every social class and undo liberal pluralism, hence cracking down on "DEI," women's rights, etc. They see this as patching vulnerabilities in the reign of capital and who gets to wield it.
