# s work at 

Inspired by Neera Tanden's work at "left-wing" advocacy group Center for American Progress, I'm announcing here today that I am founding a conservative group called "Americans for Corporate Takeover." ACT advocates for large-scale, corporate-friendly policy, like $20/hr minimum wage, universal healthcare, and ending right-to-work.
