# @bmore_radical From my perspective, you don't need to be...

@bmore_radical From my perspective, you don't need to be well-read to be informed and properly agitated about the state of the world. But you *do* need to be well-versed in theory before you start challenging *other* people's theory. @bmore_radical And by "other people's theory," of course I mean people arguing in good faith, not fascists or random internet trolls who aren't informed by material reality at all.
