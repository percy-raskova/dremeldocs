# would characterize mass more as a * function * of assets on...

@comrade_eagle I would characterize mass more as a *function* of assets on hand. If those things don't ever get reinvested into a profit-making process, they aren't relevant to discussions of profit. @comrade_eagle I.e., even if the *ratio* is low, they could still get a LOT of exploitation done just through sheer mass alone. But only if they actually invest it.
