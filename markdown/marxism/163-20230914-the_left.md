# the left

@gayest_tone The state of "the left" in the west is so fucking abysmal omg. Total lack of imagination, inability to reckon with systemic approaches, unwillingness to engage with class politics. It's all just rugged individualism, all the way down. @gayest_tone These people keep trying the same incoherent rhetorical tricks to every possible situation. It always boils down to "The current system is bad for [X] group, therefore systems in general are bad for [X] group, therefore suggesting systemic change is anti-[X]."
