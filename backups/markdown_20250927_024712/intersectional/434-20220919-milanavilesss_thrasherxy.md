# @milanavilesss @thrasherxy

@milanavilesss @thrasherxy The shift to pandemic denialism started a couple months in, once they calculated that "only" millions of people would likely die, not hundreds of millions. Worst case scenario, they'd still have enough workers and consumers to keep the profit machine rolling. @milanavilesss @thrasherxy They didn't really foresee PASC, but now that we know, they still figure a brain-damaged, stroke-prone workforce is still a workforce, as long as they still control the flow of cash and labor.

Also, capital is, by its nature very shortsighted. @milanavilesss @thrasherxy There's so much more to this than could ever be explained in a couple of tweets. I'm sure entire books and academic papers will be written on the topic of exactly why capitalism allowed this level of social destruction. Same as climate change.
