# Who cares, the world is ending

Getting reeeeeeal tired of this "Who cares, the world is ending" bullshit.

"The world" isn't going anywhere. Really really bad things are happening. Worse things are on the way.

So what? You're just going to lay down and die? Fighting back is hard, so you'll just... take it? There's a world of difference between "I don't know what to do" and "Nothing can ever be done."

There's a difference between "I'm taking a break" and "I give up."

And there's a difference between "We're facing a serious battle for survival" and "We've lost."
