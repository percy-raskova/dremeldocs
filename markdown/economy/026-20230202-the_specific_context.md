# the specific context

@matrixgoth Even disregarding the specific context of denouncing socialism, this is the dumbest political play ever. "We won't fall for your game!" they proclaim, "That's why we resolve to agree with you wholeheartedly!" @matrixgoth GOP: "Our opponents are all MONARCHISTS!"

Dems: "Ha! You fool! We hereby denounce monarchy!"
