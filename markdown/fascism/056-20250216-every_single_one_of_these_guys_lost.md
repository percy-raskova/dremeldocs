# Every single one of these guys lost

Every single one of these guys lost. Why do reactionaries constantly fetishize failure? https://t.co/iqKNTc0qyj https://t.co/NQVrZSenBb Yes, South Korea lost. The goal was to occupy the entire peninsula. They got utterly trounced by the communists, had to run crying to Dear Old Daddy, then spent the next 70-odd years in an unbeatable stalemate with one of the most economically embargoed states on the planet.
