# t weighed in on this weird background discourse about...

So far, I haven't weighed in on this weird background discourse about whether "dialectics appears in natural science" because this is the correct line: dialectics isn't "natural," it's just an analytical concept.

It's like asking "Does evenness exist in nature?" https://t.co/lMftgmJ1v5 And therefore, of course you *can* apply dialectics to nature.

Personally, I've always found dialectics to be overly simplistic. Systems--both natural and social--have myriad positive and negative feedback loops and constituent systems and interactions with other systems, etc.
