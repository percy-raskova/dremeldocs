# m sure, but ultimately counterproductive--to define 

There is an impulse--well-intentioned, I'm sure, but ultimately counterproductive--to define "lanes" for people in response to tragedy. For example, to try to triangulate who is "allowed" to take fascist attacks personally.

This has two major problems. The first is that this acts to replace real empathy with sympathy, and radicalization with tepid emotional support. If you don't take it ALL personally, you're not personally invested in the solution. You get to feel good about sitting on the sidelines and "supporting" from afar. The second is that this IS personal to all of us. Not only does Nazi ideology view the vast majority of people as enemies--including all people of color, Jews, queer people, etc.--it also extends to anyone who simply tolerates the *existence* of these people. Fascism is an existential threat to all of us. Even if you're white, straight, able-bodied, middle income. Right now, they're targeting "easy prey": people the existing state already has total antipathy toward. Their project is to codify that antipathy and expand it. Do not submit to the well-meaning urge to "give people space" and in doing so alienate yourself from the struggle. Feel the mortal terror as deeply and as personally as you can muster. Let it radicalize you. Let it prepare you. Let it define your solidarity.
