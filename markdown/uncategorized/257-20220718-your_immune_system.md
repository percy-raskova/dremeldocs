# your immune system

@CollinJFoster When you get infected, your cells chop up pieces of the thing infecting you and put them on their surface to help your immune system figure out what it's fighting. SARS-CoV-2 suppresses the immune system's ability to do that, making it hard to fight back. @CollinJFoster Normally, after you get infected or vaccinated, your immune system "remembers" what those pieces look like, so you can fight back really quickly next time. But SARS-CoV-2 makes it so, memory or not, it still takes a long time for the response to kick in at all.
