# d still be passionately fighting to educate people on...

I'd still be passionately fighting to educate people on COVID, even if I wasn't affected by long COVID.

But as it is, my life is a constant cycle of completely crashing after the "exertion" of a typical work week. Not even physically demanding, just... being out and about. If you think it can't happen to you, you're a fool. If you think it can't be worse, you're a fool. If you think your latest infection was "mild," get back to me in a few months. There's no cure, there's no proven treatment. Vaccination provides almost no protection against it. All there is is prevention. Don't. Get. COVID.

If you get COVID, redouble your efforts. Every reinfection increases the risk. The damage accumulates.
