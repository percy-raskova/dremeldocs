# the only communist country

@KraljevPeter @RickdaBuffalo Cuba, the only communist country in the western hemisphere, just passed the most radically pro-queer legislation in history. This is following decades of undoing leftover chauvinism from the colonial era. Chauvinism Castro himself fell prey too, then later apologized for. @KraljevPeter @RickdaBuffalo They still have plenty of room to grow, there are still gaps that need to be filled in the realm of queer rights, gender relations, the status of racialized peoples, etc. But they're making undeniable strides that chauvinists like yourself would decry as "identity politics."
