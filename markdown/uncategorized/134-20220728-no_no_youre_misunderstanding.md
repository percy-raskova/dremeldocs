# No no, you're misunderstanding

@MaddMardigan88 No no, you're misunderstanding! It's 5 days, after which you maybe want to test again--but you don't have to--and if you do then, if you test positive, you should probably stay home--but only if you have symptoms!--or at least wear a mask if you go out--but we won't force you! @MaddMardigan88 uwu ğŸ‘‰ğŸ‘ˆ c-can you pwease be safe without us doing anything or giving good information? ğŸ¥ºğŸ¥ºğŸ¥º
