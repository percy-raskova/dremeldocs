# s any sort of equivalence between things that we have...

It drives me absolutely insane the way people act like there's any sort of equivalence between things that we have actually tested for effectiveness/safety and "natural remedies."

If it actually works, we would be able to verify that with science. https://t.co/2g0FWd7jX3 And yes, it's entirely possible for a "natural," "traditional," "alternative" therapy to actually be effective without us having already tested it. We just need to test it!

Once we do, we can confidently say "Yep, this works!" At which point it's just called... medicine.
