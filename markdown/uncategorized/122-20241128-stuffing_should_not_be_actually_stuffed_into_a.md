# Stuffing should not be actually stuffed into a turkey

This is actually correct. Stuffing should not be actually stuffed into a turkey. Throughout the roasting process, pathogen-laden juices from the turkey absorb into the stuffing and create a perfect environment for them to grow while the interior stays at ideal growth temperature. https://t.co/dtqviKf3ts The size of the bird means that it takes a really long time for the interior to reach a temperature that can kill the bacteria, during which time they are producing dangerous endotoxins that cannot be made safe by cooking. It's the same reason you can't just cook spoiled meat. "Oh that's fine! I'll just cook it until the stuffing reaches a safe temperature!"

Cool. Enjoy spending twice as long cooking and ending up with turkey jerky. Or trying to figure out a way to scrape every bit of stuffing back *out* of a giant, burning hot bird to finish cooking. Orrrrr you could just cook stuffing by itself. They sometimes call it dressing, but no one actually cares. It's bread, aromatic veggies, herbs, and spices, melded into a delicious, carby melange. Perfect side dish for all occasions. It doesn't also need to make you violently ill.
