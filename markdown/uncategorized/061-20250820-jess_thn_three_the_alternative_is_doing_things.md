# @jess_thn_three The alternative is *doing* things, directly

@jess_thn_three The alternative is *doing* things, directly. Building houses instead of asking for houses to be built. That's not "ceding," that's acknowledging that this isn't a productive "game" at all. It's seeing that your opponent has a trillion chips and refusing to play poker. @jess_thn_three You shouldn't "respect the rules of the game." The game was designed by the enemy to not only be nearly impossible to win, but also for "winning" to change nothing about the game itself. As long as you keep playing, the house always wins.
