# s correct in this analysis, although I do think there

@keepaustinnasty He's correct in this analysis, although I do think there's another dimension to the mechanics of fascism that he doesn't quite expand on: that of the internecine conflict between opposing fascist orientations.

I think confusion over that drives a lot of "lesser evil"-ism. @keepaustinnasty That is, Democrats and Republicans represent two very distinct, mutually intractable tendencies within Jackson's "third face fascism." They have identical class allegiances, and work within the same bourgeois framework, but with opposing visions of maintaining capital hegemony. @keepaustinnasty I'm not just being pedantic here, I think this confusion is incredibly detrimental for communists, as we fight against reformism. It's easy to fall into the trap of looking at the two fascisms and trying to triangulate which is a better "temporary ally," when both want us dead.
