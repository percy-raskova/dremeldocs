# @AlexGaggio @SonyaHerridge

@AlexGaggio @SonyaHerridge @benryanwriter I am NOT making the claim that SARS-CoV-2 is the same as HIV which is the same as EBV. They are all obviously very different viruses with very different pathways, reproductive cycles, and effects on the body. Lead is not a virus at all, but I've also made that comparison. @AlexGaggio @SonyaHerridge @benryanwriter The point is to illustrate that, throughout history, we've had tons of "mysterious" chronic ailments that no one could explain. For many of those ailments, we've come to figure out their causes wayyy too late to prevent mass suffering. I want to head off that outcome for PASC. @AlexGaggio @SonyaHerridge @benryanwriter Because in this case, we already know the cause. Except the broader public consensus has already started to shift away from thinking that COVID matters at all. When in reality, the effects are just beginning.
