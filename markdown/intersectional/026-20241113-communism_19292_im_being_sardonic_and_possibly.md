# @communism_19292 I'm being sardonic, and possibly too online

@communism_19292 I'm being sardonic, and possibly too online.

- Someone posted bragging about a large DSA gathering.

- Multiple people pointed out that none of them were wearing masks.

- An onslaught of treat hitlers wriggled out of the woodwork to condemn anyone caring about COVID. @communism_19292 - Cue the same old back-and-forth about disability and ableism that pops up every month or so, with no one learning a lesson

- Cue someone posting "a fascist worked out today, did you?" to harken back to a previous iteration of "caring about disability is silly"
