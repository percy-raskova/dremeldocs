# the divergent interests

It is neither anti-Marxist nor anti-Leninist to contend with the divergent interests of disparate subclasses.

The interests of any population emerge out of the material relations constructed around them, not some immutable essence particular to the individuals within them. https://t.co/q3VDruOy3o Those populations subsequently choose to either advance those interests by reinforcing those material relations, or they achieve class consciousness, and combat the old interests, establishing new relations and new class interests. These divergent interests aren't simple liberal obfuscations to hide the economic reality of the global working class: they're the product of -- and feed back into -- real economic constructs. The relations become real through their continual advancement.

https://t.co/m9MGhmyQVf To call it "anti-Marxist and anti-Leninist" to reckon with the extant state of things is the real obfuscation. It is the duty of revolutionaries to expose these realities, to denaturalize the liberal, imperialist construct, and to advance a new consciousness that combats it. This is the reason the hammer and sickle was created in the first place: it represents the creation of a new class consciousness that aligned the interests of the proletariat and peasantry. Understanding diverging interests is not the same as conceding their permanence. In fact, it is the only way to achieve a new world, where there are *no* divergent interests. Where there is no way to benefit by the exploitation of others. Where there is nothing to be gained by ecological destruction. Where there are no classes whatsoever.

This is communism.
