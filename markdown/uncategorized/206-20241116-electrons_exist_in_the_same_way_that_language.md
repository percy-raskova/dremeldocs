# Electrons exist, in the same way that language exists and...

Electrons exist, in the same way that language exists and laws exist and life exists and YOU exist, etc. It's all social convention, ascribing discrete "realness" to relational phenomena. "Electron" is a descriptor for an identifiable packet of contextual influence. https://t.co/Bqp9RQGTlc "Electrons do not exist" is sophistry on the scale of "reality is not real, we're all just living in a simulation." Our conception of reality constrains all possible scenarios, tethered by the simple question of "So what?" In every possible way that matters, electrons "exist."
