# average people on the street

@LisaMcCray As someone with no income, no insurance, more than $10,000 in student debt, and deep ties to "average people on the street," this person sounds wayyy more insular and privileged than anyone I've met.

In reality, actual working class people care about other working class people. @LisaMcCray It smacks of real privilege to think that we're all crabs in a bucket, wishing nothing but misery on each other and nothing but gain for ourselves. I know people who never went to college, people who got full scholarships, people who paid it all off. They all think $10k is petty.
