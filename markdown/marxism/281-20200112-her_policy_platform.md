# Her policy platform

Her policy platform is the strongest by far of any candidate in the race. Medicare for All, Green New Deal, $22/hr minimum wage, banning right-to-work laws, ending forever wars, massive expansion of public transit, tuition-free higher education, and on and on. No other candidate comes close to her on issues that will improve the lives of working people. She is the only candidate who has pledged to be a day one co-sponsor of Medicare for All. She is the only one who sees the unholy alliance of the moneyed class and white supremacy for what it is, and has plans to end to horrors of war and police brutality. And most importantly, she is the only one who I trust to actually *fight* for these crucial issues. Her record in the state legislature is one of taking on causes--like rooting out corruption--and fighting endlessly for them. Her cash-strapped campaign is buouyed by an army of volunteers who want to see their concerns fought for in congress, and she is not someone who forgets where she comes from. If you support @BernieSanders for president, you should understand that his plan for getting things done involves directing a massive working class movement to put pressure on holdouts until they give us what we demand or get voted out of office. Every other candidate would be another item on his agenda, someone to fight against--Jill would be there, fighting right alongside him.
