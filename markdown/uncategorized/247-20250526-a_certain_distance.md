# a certain distance

@Rodnerdd Think of numbers as instructions to go a certain distance: "3" means "step forward 3 steps."

You start out facing right, which is positive. Multiplying the instruction by -1 just means "turn around." If you were facing right, you're now facing left, and vice versa. @Rodnerdd If your previous instruction was +3 (meaning "facing right, go 3 steps"), multiplying by -3 means "multiply by -1 (turn and face left) and then do your previous instructions three times (walk 9 steps)."
