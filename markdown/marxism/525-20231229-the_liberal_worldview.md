# the liberal worldview

The use of "brand" here is reflective of the liberal worldview, that any appearance of "activism" is simply a marketing opportunity, that championing a cause is simply a pathway to personal advancement. Under liberalism, there is no legitimate political project, only branding. https://t.co/8UFMfwT99v "Impressive stamina," because, if we are as craven as they are, clearly we've been taking it too far, long past the point of marketability. It simply doesn't compute to these people that any of us would continue to maintain our convictions to this extent, with nothing to gain. Where is the pivot? Why haven't we modulated our position to appeal to the shifting current of apathy? Why aren't we cashing in on being the outspoken opposition who came into the fold for the sake of "normalcy" and "civility"?

To these scions of capital, it makes no sense. But maybe the solution is that we're... not a brand? We're not trying to carve out a public relations niche to advance our personal position: we're a movement. Our values don't change, so our message doesn't change. Our "stamina" comes from our unending desire for a just world.
