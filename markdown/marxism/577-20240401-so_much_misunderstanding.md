# so much misunderstanding

It's getting increasingly frustrating to see so much misunderstanding of fascism. This is such a crucial error among western Marxists: so much hinges on recognizing and understanding the enemy.

But I can't just toss out quick replies, because the subject can't be condensed. I'm in the process of writing a book on the intersecting dynamics of fascism, liberalism, and capitalism. They can't be conflated, nor can they be disentangled. Politics, economy, and philosophy must be understood dialectically if we are to stand a chance of coherent struggle. At some point, I'll try to post a suitable summary of the main theses I'm working on. In the meantime, I highly recommend George Jackson's Blood in My Eye to begin understanding just how pertinent a holistic analysis of fascism in the US empire is to our movement.
