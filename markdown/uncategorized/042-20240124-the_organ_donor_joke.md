# the organ donor joke

@killerguerilla Totally fumbled the organ donor joke. Could've been "They asked me if I wanted to be an organ donor, and I said yes, because I'm an amazing person. And then they asked if I wanted to donate $2 to the organ donor society, and I thought... mmmm... Nah, not THAT amazing." @killerguerilla Pretty basic comedy: you can't follow "fake" bragging with indignation, otherwise people think you might *actually* be that self-centered. The only way to stick the landing is to undercut the brag with self-effacement.
