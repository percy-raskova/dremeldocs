# my former colleagues

@probablykaffe I will say that (most of) my former colleagues in the Baltimore City public school system were *very* focused on the state's role at the root of the issues. Particularly the ones who were actually part of the communities they worked in. @probablykaffe It was and still is very much an active battlefield within the union, between those who want the union to be a negotiation tool to get a pay raise and those who see it as a tool for addressing the needs of the poorest communities. @probablykaffe The latter camp, of course, has made themselves enemies of the national union by not toeing the line.

I'm not disputing the thesis about the overall tendency of labor, but where there are more radical currents, they exist in the same communities targeted by the state in general.
