# passionate about social justice and equality

Within every liberal, there is a fascist waiting to blossom, no matter how "passionate about social justice and equality" they proclaim to be. They hate queer people, Black people, Indigenous people, disabled people, etc. and are simply holding back for political expediency. https://t.co/9MusPWnHRv We see this in "believe women" being secondary to supporting their guy. We see this in jabs coloring their opponents as secretly queer. We see this in their unwavering support for police. We see this in the pivot from "believe science" to "COVID is 'only' harming the disabled." Liberalism is, above all else, the political ideology of capitalism. Whether it's "progressive" or "regressive" liberalism is largely a matter of aesthetics to these people. For the liberal, pluralism is simply another tool of keeping property relations safe from revolution. The moment right-fascists firmly seize state power, the moment genocide begins in earnest, millions like this man here will cease their perfunctory hashtags and slogans. They will report their neighbors for subversive attitudes. We have seen this play out so many times. We see it play out today, with their fingers hovering over 911 at all moments. We see it with people bearing "In this house we believe..." yard signs drawing weapons on Black children. We see it in endless support for the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border. When you look at a liberal, you are looking at a "just following orders" Nazi functionary-in-waiting. They don't care about liberation -- in fact, they despise the very concept. Their only priority is maintaining their own status in a stratified society.
