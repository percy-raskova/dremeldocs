# great events

@willsoc1917 Either our job as communists is to do absolutely nothing while we wait around for "great events" to randomly trigger people into radicalization -- in which case this discussion is moot -- or we should be building a movement right now. The topic in question is *how* we build. @willsoc1917 The same logic of dismissing survival programs as irrelevant because "radicalization happens because of Great Events™️" can be applied to literally anything communists do, from book clubs to newspapers to impotently tweeting. @willsoc1917 My point was that trotskyists clearly don't buy into the nonsense claim of "nothing we do matters, so sit on your ass," because they ARE trying to do something -- they just think selling newspapers is valid, while survival programs are not. Hence the entire premise of the thread.
