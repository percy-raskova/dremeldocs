# this several year educational period

So glad to live in a country where "professional" means "can afford to pay for college AND an extra school afterward AND testing AND not have any income during this several year educational period."

Wonder why we have a shortage of teachers ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” I'm only a teacher because Baltimore happens to be so hard up for teachers that they were willing to hire me with "just" a bachelor's degree, so I can at least have an income while I work on (and pay for) the rest.
