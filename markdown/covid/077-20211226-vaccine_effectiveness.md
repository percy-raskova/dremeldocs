# vaccine effectiveness

Here's another study looking at vaccine effectiveness against omicron, this time in England. In this one, they show that getting a booster of Pfizer recovers much of the vaccine effectiveness against *symptomatic* disease, rising up to 75.5%.

https://t.co/jc6z76vw6d https://t.co/j2gUA8bk9c It should be noted that the sample size for omicron among boosted population was only 16 for Pfizer, and the 95% confidence interval is anywhere from 56.1% to 86.3%. So again, we still need more data to be able to say that omicron is less of a threat.
