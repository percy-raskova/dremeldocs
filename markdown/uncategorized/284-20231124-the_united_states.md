# The United States

The United States of America will never be a sovereign country. Ever.

The US is a tattered burlap sack stuffed with festering carrion and maggots, haphazardly stitched together with strands of sugar. Yet you treat this crude homunculus, this insult to humanity, like a god. https://t.co/1Xjy6qmHXq And no, it's not because of Zionism. "Israel" is a blob of half-rotten putrescence that spilled out of the sack.
