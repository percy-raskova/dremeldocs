# biblically accurate angels

The entire concept of "biblically accurate angels" is already a Tumblr thing. The vast majority of mentions of angels in the bible, they're described as looking like Just Some Dude™️, and it's only revealed later that they were an angel. https://t.co/HgiI6jRV2l The flaming wheels of eyes imagery comes from the book of Ezekiel, which is very apocalyptic and grandiose in general. There, the "angels" aren't even referred to as such in the original text. They're celestials, but sorting them as a class of angels is a latter interpretation.
