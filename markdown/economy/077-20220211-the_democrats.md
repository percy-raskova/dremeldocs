# The Democrats

The Democrats are always in such a tough position. They can't give people mild social reforms, like raising the minimum wage, because then we'll expect more, like wealth redistribution, which is obviously out of the question. But they can't win without giving people *something*. The Republicans, of course, can always animate their base by generating fake outrage over nonsense issues. Dems have tried to do the opposite but "We won't take away your rights*" isn't as big of a motivator as "BLACK TRANS MEXICANS ARE COMING TO DESTROY THE SUBURBS" *Especially since rights are being eroded anyway, whether Democrats are in office or not. And you can't protect civil rights without expanding economic rights, which Dems would never do.
