# the revolution life

@primarycatdad The key is that they MAKE the revolution life or death for themselves. By throwing their lot in with the movement, they make themselves enemies of the state and their class standing is overtaken by criminality. Once the state wants them dead, their commitment is assured. @primarycatdad ("Assured," save for those who might try to negotiate a separate peace with the enemy by betraying the cause, but that's a danger among any other class as well.)
