# a good time

Is now a good time to point out that people who convert to Islam calling themselves "reverts" sound unbelievably condescending and arrogant? It's on the same scale as the attitude of Mormons performing "baptisms for the dead." Where does "let people believe what they want" come in when the belief itself includes believing that the billions of non-Muslims were born Muslim and are too stubborn to "go back" to their "natural faith"? Not to mention the tens of billions who lived before Islam even existed. You have every right to believe that I am "willfully ignorant" for not believing in your faith and that I have been "led astray" -- it is naked hypocrisy to act like it is inherently more disrespectful of me to reject the premise entirely. The same is true of the concepts of "Buddha-nature" or "Sensus divinitatis."

This is the most practical reason communism is necessarily 100% secular: there is no place in our ideology for mutually exclusive claims to universality. Whatever other beliefs you hold, either you reject any tenet of "natural faith" or you reject the agency of your many comrades. Unless you believe you will convert the world, you must either get comfortable following foolish nonbelievers or stop believing they're foolish.
