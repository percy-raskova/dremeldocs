# s no way to assert anything as 

@RachelNagant The central axiom of materialism is that the universe is built on universal laws; otherwise, there's no way to assert anything as "true."

Any "exceptions" to those laws are not actually disobeying the fundamental structure of reality: they just reveal further nuance to the law. @RachelNagant In other words, anyone railing against "universalizing" is just saying "Shhh... No no, we are not meant to understand this world. We should move through the world based on gut instinct and mythology."
