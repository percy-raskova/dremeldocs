# s absolutely hilarious to watch liberals pull their hair...

It's absolutely hilarious to watch liberals pull their hair out, crying "Does no one remember COVID??", conveniently forgetting that Biden's entire pandemic strategy revolves around MAKING people forget about COVID. These same people whining have also dutifully forgotten COVID. https://t.co/eYB3geyhOh Turns out, when your proudest achievement is making people believe there's no issue, they don't really care that much about that issue, so you don't get any credit for it.
