# @EclecticRadical Eastern Germany

@EclecticRadical Eastern Germany did actual denazification. Western Germany not only tolerated Nazis, but gave them high-ranking government positions.

(They also thought of East Germany as "middle Germany" and sought to eventually recapture stolen Polish land.) @EclecticRadical This was all done with the full backing of Western powers, who preferred a Nazi bulwark against communism. They even prohibited the redistribution of property from Nazi-collaborating industrial oligarch, despite overwhelming support from the people for nationalization.
