# observable phenomena

@bhad_bhussy You're mixing up observable phenomena and theoretical frameworks. Gravity (the tendency of objects with mass to attract toward each other) and evolution (the tendency of species to change over time) are observably true. You can watch them happen and see that they are true. @bhad_bhussy Chiropractic claims to be the same, except the observations aren't there. It's a claim about something that should happen... and then that thing not happening. @bhad_bhussy "Intersectionality" isn't an observable phenomenon, it's a way of sorting and explaining the phenomena you observe. You can't "prove" or "disprove" intersectionality. All you can do is demonstrate that it is or is not a useful way of looking at things.
