# Astronomically terrible writing

Astronomically terrible writing on every possible front. DMS is an extremely common reagent. I used it myself in undergraduate organic chemistry courses. If you mention DMS to anyone who's heard of it, I guarantee none of them would ever leap to "chemical weapon." https://t.co/tL2vtCUnW0 "Your symptoms are consistent with exposure to DMS" is also an insane line of dialogue. Symptoms like what? Renal failure? Airway edema? There is nothing unique to DMS. The only rational conclusion would be "Your symptoms are consistent with exposure to environmental toxins." I have tried my best to ignore the onslaught of Good Doctor nonsense that keeps cropping up on my feed, because we all know it's terrible, slanderous, Autism Speaks bullshit. But come ON. Hire ONE professional if you're going to make a show about doctors.
