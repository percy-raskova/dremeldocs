# Yes, I am also mad at that guy you made up to get mad at

@MaxGhenis Yes, I am also mad at that guy you made up to get mad at!

Obviously it's better for there to be an apartment than a mansion, in the same way that it's better to give charity than to *not* give charity.

The issue is when people act like these non-solutions are THE solution. @MaxGhenis Market-based solutions don't solve anything for the poorest people. There are no left-NIMBYs in the way you're thinking: there are just left-seize-the-housing-market people. Housing needs to be considered a human right, not a commodity.
