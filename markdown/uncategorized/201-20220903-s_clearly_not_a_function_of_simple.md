# s clearly not a function of simple 

@MatthewBarba4 @katewillett Rent rises much MUCH faster than population, so it's clearly not a function of simple "demand" in the sense of there being more people who want housing. Demand in this sense is actually a function of how much profit landlords feel they can extract from the population. @MatthewBarba4 @katewillett If they can make more profit by doubling their prices (even if it means they only manage to rent out 66% of their stock), that's what they do. That has nothing to do with how much stock there actually is.
