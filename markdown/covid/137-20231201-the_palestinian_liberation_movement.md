# The Palestinian liberation movement

The Palestinian liberation movement IS organized democratic mass politics, as is revolution in general. It's led by a broad coalition of ideologically distinct groups, united in struggle, and holding the overwhelming mandate of the masses of the oppressed. https://t.co/J9YhZwXe3x What Meagan is referring to with "democratic mass politics" is the self-flagellating ritual of peacefully begging oppressors for liberation -- a liberation they will never willingly cede. It does NOT have a great track record, except for those who benefit from that oppression. There is no legal path to victory wherever victory requires a wholly new system: the existing system made the very laws that uphold it.

Stop falling for liberal misdirection and moralizing.
