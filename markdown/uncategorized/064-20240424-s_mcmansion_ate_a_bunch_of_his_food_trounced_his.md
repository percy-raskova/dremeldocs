# s McMansion, ate a bunch of his food, trounced his friends...

Suddenly remembering that time I walked into a libertarian professor's McMansion, ate a bunch of his food, trounced his friends at board games, made a closeted gay "religious free speech" activist have an existential crisis because of his attraction to me, then left. He spent the day following me around like a lost puppy, not realizing he was flirting with me and that I was flirting back. I later added him on Facebook, then saw he was interning for something like "First Amendment Religious Rights Legal Foundation" ðŸ¤£
