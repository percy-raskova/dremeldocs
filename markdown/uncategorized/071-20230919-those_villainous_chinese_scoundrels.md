# those villainous Chinese scoundrels

@NateB_Panic Easy: those villainous Chinese scoundrels, with malice aforethought, tried to unleash a bioweapon upon the world. But then, our unflappable Western immune systems ended up easily fight it off, due to genetic superiority (except for the weak, who must "fall by the wayside")! ðŸ™ƒ @NateB_Panic It's actually a very easy "logical" narrative to come to, when you're ideologically committed to white supremacy, eugenics, nationalism, anti-communism, etc.
