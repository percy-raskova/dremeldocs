# established concepts

It is absolutely unthinkable that the "experts" have simply overlooked the data on SARS-CoV-2 for 3 years. They could not have "forgotten" established concepts, like the dynamics of viral evolution, the mechanics of airborne transmission, the implications of immune dysregulation. They are not ignorant. The questions they refused to ask themselves were asked, answered, and answered again. Over and over, study after study has dug the grave of all their false optimism. They have not simply missed every piece of news and forgotten all the literature. None of this top-level COVID minimization is a simple case of misreading, misinterpreting, misremembering, or misstating. No "expert" is that stupid. It is deliberate. They are lying with every breath. Ideologically committed to mass death and disability in service of profit.
