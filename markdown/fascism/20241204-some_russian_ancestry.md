# some Russian ancestry

The funny thing about fascists trying to apply hot-off-the-grill anti-Russian slurs to me is that I *do* actually have some Russian ancestry. All of my great-grandparents fled antisemitic persecution across various eastern and central European countries, and met up in the US. I know intimately what your nationalism means. It was used as a tool to tear apart socialist states that had previously put an end to centuries of pogroms. It's not even a little shocking to see fascists carry the banner. Go be proud of your "national heritage" somewhere else. Basically what I'm saying is my gut reaction to "Haha Russian 🫵" is... yeah? And? You and your buddies have never seen me as anything other than an insidious alien element. Why would I give a shit what you think? At least I've been elevated in your mind from "vermin" to "orc."
