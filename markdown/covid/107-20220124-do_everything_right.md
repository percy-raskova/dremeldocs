# do everything right

You want to know the real way to "do everything right"?

1. Fully vaccinated, with most recent booster &lt;6 months ago.

2. Never leave your house without wearing N95

3. Spend no more than 15 minutes in an enclosed space with fewer than 10 ACH 4. If your job must be done in an enclosed space with others present, quit.

5. Rapid antigen test twice a week.

6. Live alone, or with others who follow these rules religiously.

Notice how it's impossible unless you're a wealthy hermit? Getting COVID is not a moral failing.
