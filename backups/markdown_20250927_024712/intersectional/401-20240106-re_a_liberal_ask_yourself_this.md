# re a liberal, ask yourself this: 

If you're a liberal, ask yourself this: "Do I want my favorite party to have more power?"

If not, why do you support them? Clearly not for the things they claim to want to accomplish, if you want it to be harder for them to actually accomplish those things. https://t.co/eGKLjDv5Nu And if you DO want them to have more power... how much? You want them to have a majority, sure, but how about a supermajority? Would 80% be too much power? If the Democrats won 90% of the seats in Congress, would you campaign for Republicans to "preserve democracy?" If you're confused why people are opting out of the electoral process altogether, it's because of that exact dynamic. They're putting two and two together. The basic precepts of liberal democracy lead to the very logical conclusion that it's not *meant* to work for us. So which is it? Do you want Democrats to have a one-party dictatorship? Do you want Republicans to have the power to block them? Or do you (bizarrely) want Democrats to have enough power to fulfill all those big promises, but with a few Republicans to lodge perfunctory no votes?
