# do n't even need a B+ in Intro to Calculus to grasp this 

You don't even need a B+ in Intro to Calculus to grasp this. https://t.co/sSe5zcyJoh https://t.co/EbY0uehiEM I would like to issue my sincere apologies to all the liberals in my mentions for not using calculus in my post about how you are simply never going to convince voters that things are fine by using calculus to find a way to reframe their concerns as no big deal. 🥱 You lost.

You lost when you had to pull out the original graph, you lost harder when you had to explain the difference between YoY and MoM, and you lost hardest of all when you said "Yeah, of course rent always goes up. Things getting worse is totally natural and unavoidable." Sorry your entire economic system is fundamentally structured around squeezing the working class and that we've decided we don't like that.

Sorry you're wasting your time trying to squeeze the water of assent from the rock of people not giving a shit about bourgeois "democracy."
