# @BenjaminPDixon Whew

@BenjaminPDixon Whew! Just kind of rambled for two straight minutes about how city-dwelling leftists have been completely abdicating the rural half of our working class base, and how until we stop playing the liberals' game, we will never stop losing. @BenjaminPDixon Identity politics is a dead-end. We can't ignore the realities of systemic racism, patriarchy, etc., but we *need* to understand why ordinary folks vote for the people who keep these systems of inequity in place, and that doesn't happen by decrying them as automatically evil.
