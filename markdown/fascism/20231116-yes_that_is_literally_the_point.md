# Yes, that is literally the point

Yes, that is literally the point. "Winning in elections" is demonstrably not an avenue for achieving social change, and never has been. So we engage on more productive battlefields -- such as literal battlefields. https://t.co/Q2ROCTRA8S You liberal motherfuckers would have been against the US civil war because it was "authoritarian," and "subverted democracy" 🙄 And by "would have," of course I mean "were," because there was a huge contingent of liberals crying bloody murder over Lincoln's "overreach," before and during the war.

"Oh, of COURSE we think slavery is barbaric, but this just goes TOO FAR! We have to uphold The Norms™️!"
