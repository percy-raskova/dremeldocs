# a semantic issue

@FoxyMarxist The "sundering" is a semantic issue being pushed by opponents of both, attempting to appear nominally sympathetic to one. @FoxyMarxist Linguistic specificity is indeed a useful tool in many respects, but contextually, we're seeing people trying to use it to deride people who are actively engaged in material struggle -- particularly indigenous Marxists -- as being disingenuous, illegitimate liberals.
