# the specific org

@Rocko64_ It definitely says something about the specific org if it's even possible for a predator to climb to the top of the pile. It's either populated with people who have no bullshit detectors, or (more commonly) the people with bullshit detectors have minimal power within the org. @Rocko64_ Like, it seems pretty obvious why predators are able to reach the heights of power in say, governments or corporations. But in an org that claims to be "people powered," it tells you just how democratic it really is.
