# US left needs to get way way wayyyy more serious 

The US left needs to get way way wayyyy more serious. Everyone seems completely fine with dicking around with piddling bullshit. Protests and online debates and elections and dissertations and endless slews of factions trying to triangulate juuuust the right flavor of left. It is all totally irrelevant.

Our enemies have guns, money, state support, captured media, and a severe lust for blood. They act with impunity and grow stronger every day.

But it's not like it's hopeless. We just need to take real, deliberate, productive action.
