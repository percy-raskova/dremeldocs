# Seriously, it sounds corny, but you legitimately have to...

Seriously, it sounds corny, but you legitimately have to talk to your neighbors. If you're in a highly alienating and/or counter-revolutionary environment, like the suburbs, I *strongly* recommend trying to find a new place to live. The streets are ALIVE. https://t.co/JCJBoHrBpO I'm FAR from being the most naturally social person. I'm autistic, nerdy, shy, kinda clocky, and I have a disability that leaves me horizontal most of the time. But I still manage to befriend my neighbors by being as present, as kind, and as earnest as I can be. It helps that I have enough money that I actually mean it when I say "yeah, no problem" to letting someone have some cash or a cigarette or some food. But even if you're a little hard up yourself, there are plenty of ways to be there for your people. Even just chatting them up. I've met people by helping them, I've met people by *them* offering to help me. I've met people just sitting out front, petting a stray cat. I try to remember to always ask people's names, and maybe I don't remember until the second time we meet. Maybe I never see them again. It doesn't matter if you're a bit bad at it. You can be clumsy or awkward. Just be *real*. Be *present*. It's crucial.

If you want to be effective as a revolutionary, you need to find your people. Most of them won't join your org. But they'll know you, and they'll support you.
