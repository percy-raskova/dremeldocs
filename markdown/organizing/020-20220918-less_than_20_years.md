# less than 20 years

In less than 20 years the Bolsheviks went from a small faction of a social democratic party to founding the USSR. It took them another 20 years to go from a backwards agrarian society to one of the most industrialized on the planet. https://t.co/4tJJqDlPBk The scale of what needs to be done to reverse the worst effects of climate change is likely even less than the scale of Soviet industrialization. 20 years for us to begin drawing down emissions, another 10 to complete the transition.

With revolution, we get to net-zero by 2050.
