# t have a logo is because it isn

The reason capitalism doesn't have a logo is because it isn't a movement; it's hegemonic.

The ideology that brought capitalism to dominance is called liberalism, and various liberal movements *have* had a plethora of symbols. Most notably, national symbols, like tricolors. https://t.co/9arxsCeQin In both liberalism and communism, the symbols are not monolithic -- they take inspiration from earlier iterations, and put their own spin on general patterns. Communism uses red, gold, stars, and various symbols of labor. Liberalism uses stripes of various nation-specific colors. When liberalism was a revolutionary force, its symbols were seen as subversive, powerful, unifying. People shed blood under striped banners.

Then they won. Now those symbols are the flags of the states those radicals built. They are now symbols of hegemony. Bland set dressing. The reason the hammer and sickle "goes hard" is because it still means something. Seeing it variously evokes hope, fear, disgust, courage, or righteous anger, depending on who's watching.

What does liberalism have? Nothing but staid complacency.
