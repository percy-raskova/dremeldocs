# t mean 

@MaratLives I don't mean "greatest failing" as in THE reason for the collapse of Warsaw Pact nations. More so that liberalization in places like the USSR and China led to increasing inequality, and were therefore "failure to apply socialism." @MaratLives The fact that they "all came to the same conclusion" was a result of them all living in a world still thoroughly dominated by markets. I don't mean to say they were *wrong* to make those moves! I don't pretend to know what I would have done differently in those situations. @MaratLives My point is not to denigrate existing and historical socialisms for making the choices they did, but to illustrate that those choices were definitely moves *away* from socialism. And that it would have clearly been better if they had never had to make those choices at all!
