# a ready-made revolutionary organization

@BielskiBoy Part of it is having a ready-made revolutionary organization for them to tether their desire to "help" to. This is why so many of them default to trying to find The One True Org, and lapsing into various forms of reformism under the auspices of CPUSA, DSA, et al. @BielskiBoy That is to say, we don't need to be actively seeking them out for help in building our organizations, we just need to build them. Then we can vet them, onboard them, educate them, regiment them, etc. without diluting our mission to ameliorate their sensibilities.
