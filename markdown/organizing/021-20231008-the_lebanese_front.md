# the Lebanese front

Paying close attention to the Lebanese front. I have little doubt Al-Aqsa Flood has the potential to precipitate a broader war with multiple nations.

This operation has been *highly* organized since the beginning. Part of organizing is gathering allies.

https://t.co/NBNzFnD1xc From the announcement of the operation:

"Oh, our brothers in the Islamic resistance in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, today is the day when your resistance merges with the resistance of your brothers in Palestine. It is time for the Arab resistance to unite. "We call for mobilization towards Palestine. O, our brothers in Algeria, Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, and the rest of the Arab countries, take action and heed the call."

I initially thought this was more of an impassioned plea. But now I'm thinking it was coordinated in advance.
