# @probablykaffe @FoxyMarxist This is how I always think...

@probablykaffe @FoxyMarxist This is how I always think about my writing. No matter how much has already been written, whatever we write today is still important as an update to what was written yesterday. Even just saying "This prediction from years ago has now been conclusively demonstrated" is worthwhile. @probablykaffe @FoxyMarxist Or "this writing about some other context can be applied to this one in the following ways."
