# @AlysonMetzger @JoeBiden Stop pointing out that everything...

@AlysonMetzger @JoeBiden Stop pointing out that everything he says is a lie! We need to prop him up against Trump, because everything Trump says is a lie! It's not like there are any other options, like just letting Bernie Sanders be president... @AlysonMetzger @JoeBiden To all the Trump supporters replying to this: I'm being sarcastic. I don't like Biden. I don't want Biden to win. I also don't want Trump to win. My DMs are open if you'd like to have a real conversation about why I see them as two sides of the same swamp-drowned coin.
