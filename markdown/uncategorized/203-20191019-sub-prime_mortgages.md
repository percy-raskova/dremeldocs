# sub-prime mortgages

We are *definitely* about to have a repeat of 2008. Banks are literally doing sub-prime mortgages again, Berkshire-Hathaway is buying controlling interest in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, people are getting approved for loans with 50% debt-to-income ratios, and on and on. To put it simply, lenders are once again practicing spray and prey lending, where they're actively targeting borrowers who can't afford their mortgages, hoping they'll rack up extra debt in low payments and late fees, foreclosing, then flipping the house over to the next sucker.
