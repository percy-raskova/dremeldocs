# an epidemiologist

I am not formally trained as an epidemiologist, virologist, or immunologist. I am but a humble biochemist/cell biologist who has spent the entire pandemic reading hundreds of COVID studies and doing as much background reading as I can. I am still learning more background every day. You would not believe how many times in a month I go "I can't believe I never knew that!"

And yet, I am more qualified than the glut of COVID minimizing public health "experts" out there for one simple reason: morals. From the beginning, my goal in researching the virus and the disease it causes has been focused on what we need to keep people safe. Theirs has been to protect capitalism. Any research that tells us exactly why we need to exercise caution, they suppress. You don't need a scientific background to see the need for caution. However, it has certainly been helpful for resisting the hegemonic onslaught of lies coming from "expert" voices. I've been doing my best to use science to corroborate the instincts of those who advocate safety.
