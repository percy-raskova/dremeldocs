# western education

@primarycatdad Unfortunately, western education and media have left most completely unprepared to recognize what fascism actually is. There is a thriving contingent of people who think "left fascism" is a thing. So first, people need to actually get educated on fascism. @primarycatdad And then in the other direction are people who think it's impossible for a fascist to masquerade as a communist, which is probably the more dangerous outcome of this miseducation.
