# Anthropogenic carbon emissions

Anthropogenic carbon emissions recently reached around 40 BILLION tons per year. We would need literally a million of these facilities, using more energy than we currently use across the entire global economy. https://t.co/scKtUPa2Kp Direct air capture is a complete scam, and everyone knows it. It's not a question of economics or making the technology more efficient over time: it's a thermodynamic morass that categorically cannot be addressed simply with technological tweaks. None of the investments in existing CC technology are "forays into an emerging field" any more than investing in making fossil fuels production more efficient has any bearing on developing cold fusion. It's a shell game. A con. A sleight of hand used to avoid the real issue. The capitalists would rather pretend they intend to run the treadmill of building and "sustainably powering" carbon capture to offset their energy usage, when a more direct route would obviously be simply using that new "sustainable energy" to *replace* the fossil energy. Of course, they have absolutely no plans to scale down fossil energy. Ever. The plan is to continue to expand energy use overall, using "carbon offsets" as the distracting hand, gesturing wildly while the other hand stacks the deck.

Capitalism has no conception of scaling back.
