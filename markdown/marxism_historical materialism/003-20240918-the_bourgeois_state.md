# the bourgeois state

@matrixgoth Also, it's still all owned by the bourgeois state. None of this housing stock is being taken out of the reach of capital. In the absolute BEST case scenario, a tiny sliver of the market becomes "affordable" for a little while, until it's all clawed back when deemed "wasteful." @matrixgoth "HUD is ineffective at actually providing people with housing, because it doesn't have the funding or executive power to do so, especially after decades of being deliberately disempowered."

"Here's my solution: do the exact same thing!"
