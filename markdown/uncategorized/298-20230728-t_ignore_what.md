# t ignore what

Well, here it is.

After years of self-doubt, rationalizing, pondering, making exceptions, yearning, neglect, dysphoria, and refusing to ever give myself grace, I can't ignore what's real anymore. I am feminine. I am a whole person. I am allowed to be me.

I am trans. To say I have a complicated relationship with gender is putting it mildly. I've analyzed and deconstructed and rejected and reaffirmed every which way, since I was 13. I've experimented and explored and occasionally felt something *approaching* gender euphoria. But through it all, I've never really allowed myself to "be trans." I've tried as hard as I could to pretend I was ok with the understanding that most people would read me as "masculine." But I never was. It has always killed me: a little tiny deaths, every single day. I don't know what possessed me to imagine that every trans person's experience is valid but mine. Other than the obvious: I habitually refuse to view myself rationally and kindly. I have compressed every trauma, large and small, and placed it where my self-love should be. I'm not going to air out everything here, on this hellsite. Every coping mechanism, every disorder, every self-destructive fantasy, every "Maybe they're right" that led me so far away from what I could have been. Instead, I'm just going to say this:

Now I'm free.
