# @rednewafrikan Time

@rednewafrikan Time, just like space, is a function of matter/energy. Ultra matter-dense regions of space -- black holes -- distort time around them, and matter with more energy -- i.e. moving faster -- experience time dilation. Time is, like all things, a product of its context. @rednewafrikan These effects are general and special relativity, and are among the many contributions of the great German physical dialectician, Albert Einstein. He also expounded the dialectical relationship of matter and energy (E = mc^2).
