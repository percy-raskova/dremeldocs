# Liberalism is utterly powerless to address injustice,...

Liberalism is utterly powerless to address injustice, because to them, everything is individual.

*You* can't be committed to racial justice, because *you* haven't sacrificed familial bonds, because *your family* also can't be committed, etc.

Organize your goddamn community. https://t.co/w4cC3dwYpT Your commitment to racial justice is tested exclusively by what social and economic systems you are willing to actively destroy in the pursuit of a decolonized society. This is impossible under capitalism. It *is* possible without excommunicating non-radicalized family. My entire family is full of white, progressive liberal Jews. They are not communists. They do not see the need to eradicate all of the structures of capitalism in the pursuit of racial justice.

And yet, they are not my enemy. They are just normal people.
