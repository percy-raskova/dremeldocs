# the Democrats

I'm hearing a lot of talk about potential election rigging by the Democrats, citing discrepancies between exit polls and results. I don't know whether or not I believe that they literally threw out Bernie votes.

But I do know that focusing on that completely misses the point. Whether it's media complicity, coordination between centrist candidates, dark money, appeals to voters' fears, or outright tampering with the results, the establishment has far more tools at their disposal than we do. And more importantly, the willingness to use them. Outsiders have only one tool available to us: people. Fortunately, we can use that tool millions of times.

The establishment understands power. Do you?
