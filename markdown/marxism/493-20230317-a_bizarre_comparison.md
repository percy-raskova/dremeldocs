# a bizarre comparison

@quantian1 This is a bizarre comparison, and not at all close to the phenomenon I'm describing. I feel like you're arguing with a misinterpretation of what Marxian economics asserts? @quantian1 I'd love to continue this discussion, because it seems like you're actually arguing in good faith, but I have to go to work now.
