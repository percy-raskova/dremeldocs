# @MarxIsMyNigga We also need to support struggles there at...

@MarxIsMyNigga We also need to support struggles there at the same time! All across the empire, whether in the core territories, the acknowledged colonies, or the totally-not-a-colony-we-don't-do-that colonies, we all need to be making life hell for the imperial forces. @MarxIsMyNigga We distract the US from foreign intervention, they distract the US from internal repression. Everyone wins!
