# entertain this hypothetical scenario where they would want...

@m1vql1hdwt When I say "trust," I mean "entertain this hypothetical scenario where they would want to ally with us on anything beyond a tepid ballot measure or a peaceful protest." @m1vql1hdwt If they do go along with us on a particular fight, then sure, let them. I just meant I don't have much optimism for that actually happening.

But I think your broader point might be that it shouldn't be *our* fault if alliances fail to form? Which I agree with.
