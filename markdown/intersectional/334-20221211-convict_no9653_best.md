# @Convict_No9653 Best

@Convict_No9653 Best I can do is religious tolerance. Non-materialist worldviews can never be the foundation of socialist projects, which MUST be rooted entirely in verifiable, material reality. But *oppressing* religion just drives people deeper into reactionary beliefs and movements. @Convict_No9653 That said, obviously I would *work* with explicitly-religious, explicitly-communist groups. Religion bugs me, but the fact that I view it as a byproduct of oppression means all I have to do to see it fade is eliminate oppression! If I'm wrong, and it persists, then no harm done!
