# ll give it a shot:



My Hebrew is a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot:

"Hello, My name is Yagil Yaakov. I am 13 years old. I miss my family and my friends. And I love you, and I want to say thank you very much." https://t.co/BJU4l2gj47 He's not translating because he doesn't actually understand Hebrew if he thinks "אני בן שלוש עשרה" means "I am 12 years old."

https://t.co/eIoYychnCE "And I strengthen you, all the supporters in Tel Aviv right now, trying to (?) the government until I return home – and all the hostages.

I want to say to Netanyahu that it is simply unbelievable – all these bombs are simply crazy." "You are killing children and you're killing even the hostages. You don't return the water and the energy and the medicine, and we – the (?) hostages need this. Not just the Palestinians, us." "I want to say thank you very much to all the (?) that are currently in Tel Aviv and I hope that I will return (?) quickly, because all the time I'm here, I am in greater danger." "And thank you very much to (?) that protect me here in Gaza, that I will not die, that I have food and water – as much as I need – and medicine, and everything." "Netanyahu, I want to tell you that if anything happens to me, that is your (?) – and also any of the hostages here – that's your (?). Because the Jihad fighters here, they are working very hard to keep all of us safe. Thank you."
