# critical reasoning skills

can someone tell me what voting is gonna do for anyone at all, explain it like im older than 7 and therefore have critical reasoning skills and need an answer beyond vague idealism https://t.co/K2TwZiMKdz You don't need a reason *not* to do something, you need a reason to do it.
