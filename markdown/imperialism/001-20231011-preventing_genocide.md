# Preventing genocide

"Preventing genocide" is exactly the justification the Zionists are using right now, as they attempt to starve and flatten Gaza. They have slaughtered over 1,000 civilians since the bombing began, claiming "This is the only way we will know peace." https://t.co/Kyzbzlx46W While the Zionists are proud to be pursuing a strategy of elimination, the resistance adamantly denies a strategy of specifically targeting civilians. One side says "We are fighting human animals, and act accordingly," the other says "We aim to end military occupation." One side has completely cut off electricity, food, water, and medical aid from the concentration camp they have operated, and are now bombing it indiscriminately, a strategy that almost entirely targets civilians. The other side has stormed barracks and bombed tanks.
