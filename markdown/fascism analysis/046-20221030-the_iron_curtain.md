# the Iron Curtain

Truly deranged that liberals *to this day* still refer to "the Iron Curtain" described by none other than Goebbels himself. Parroting fascist rhetoric like it's gospel.

https://t.co/gOjoAio2Hg https://t.co/ySyH537kBb Technically, they're parroting Churchill, who was parroting Goebbels. Churchill, for those who don't know, was practically a fascist himself, and until the Nazis invaded France, he was constantly about 5 minutes away from forming an Anglo-Nazi pact.
