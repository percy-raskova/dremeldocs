# a public forum

I realize I never specifically came out and said it in a public forum, so here it is: last week, I tested positive for COVID. Despite being fully vaccinated, avoiding unnecessary outings, and wearing a mask at all times outside my home, I was bedridden with COVID symptoms for two days. It's impossible to know where I'd be if not for the vaccine. We know for certain that the vaccines reduce risk of serious illness and death. But there's no such thing as 100%, especially with such an infectious and widespread virus. Everyone should be getting vaccinated to keep themselves as safe as possible. But that isn't enough on its own to completely stop the spread. Unless and until businesses and schools fully shut down, the virus will continue to rampage. We have missed our shot to prevent this disease from becoming endemic. We will likely see COVID resurgences indefinitely. This isn't the fault of individuals trying to keep themselves afloat: it's institutional failing. In 20 years, as we fight through yet another COVID season, never forget that this could have been avoided if not for economic and political forces deciding your health was secondary.
