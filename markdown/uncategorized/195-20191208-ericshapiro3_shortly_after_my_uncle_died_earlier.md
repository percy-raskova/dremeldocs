# @EricShapiro3 Shortly after my uncle died, earlier this...

@EricShapiro3 Shortly after my uncle died, earlier this year, I mentioned to my aunt that I didn't believe in God.

She gave me a giant hug and said "I'm so sick of everyone telling me he's looking down at me from heaven. It just doesn't help when I know it's not true!" @EricShapiro3 Interestingly, all those "heaven" comments were coming from her Christian friends, not my suuuuper religious, Jewish family.
