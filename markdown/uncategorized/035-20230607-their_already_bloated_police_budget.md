# their already bloated police budget

This is all happening during a budget hearing, where the police are begging to add even more of the city's money to their already bloated police budget. Because they clearly need more funding.

https://t.co/0FAtihe7wE https://t.co/OpndNPGEOM They are brutalizing people and screaming at reporters. In addition to pinning a man and a woman to the ground, they are blocking them from getting to their baby. An EMT is on the scene to examine the man, who may have sustained injuries. The police have no restraint, no basic human decency, and nothing but contempt for the people they oppress.
