# @Univ_ComradesNA National liberation

@Univ_ComradesNA National liberation has never been synonymous with socialism. It's simply a prerequisite/outgrowth of dismantling imperialism, which is a prerequisite/outgrowth of dismantling capitalism, which is a prerequisite/outgrowth of building socialism. @Univ_ComradesNA If you're not interested in national liberation, you're not interested in socialism. Plain and simple.

If you *are* interested in national liberation, you *still* might not be interested in socialism. We can deal with that if it needs to be dealt with. Probably not anytime soon.
