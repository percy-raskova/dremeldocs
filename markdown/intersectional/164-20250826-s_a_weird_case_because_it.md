# s a weird case, because it

@probablykaffe Baltimore's a weird case, because it's one of the only districts in the state where the union is a local of AFT, while most of the rest is part of NEA (which is more of a "professional association"). There technically is an "AFT-Maryland," but it's de facto: city -&gt; national. @probablykaffe BTU represents not just teachers, but also paraprofessionals and school-related personnel: nurses, secretaries, librarians, social workers, bus aides, cafeteria workers, classroom aides, etc. The non-teacher half is much more "in situ," while there are teachers who commute in. @probablykaffe I'm not as familiar with the "nicer schools," but in poorer parts of the district, gaps in school staffing are filled by families of the students volunteering to do things like help with dismissal, cafeteria duty, classroom assistance. Small schools are very "it takes a village."
