# the Democratic party

I think it's safe to say that Obama--who did nothing with a STACKED congress--single-handedly ended any illusions that the Democratic party cares about ordinary working people. He had two years to pass a living wage, a real healthcare bill, end the wars, a stimulus for people more than banks, etc. He didn't, so no one showed up in 2010.

THEN, he didn't have the votes.

ONLY AFTER HE DID NOTHING WITH THOSE VOTES. Elect as many Democrats as you want. Even when they control the entire government, including a supermajority in the senate, they will never help you.
