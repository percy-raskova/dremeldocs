# the left- and right-wing working class

How do you bridge the gap between the left- and right-wing working class without giving a pass to bigotry?

Build a worker-centered movement led by black people, queer people, immigrants, women, etc. and AGGRESSIVELY court self-identified "conservatives." You'll encounter people for whom those identities are a non-starter, who will not join the movement. You'll encounter a LOT more people that don't really care. They wouldn't think to center those people in their own movements, but they have bigger priorities than keeping us out. The result? You pillage the Republican party's base, bolstering your ranks with people who aren't *bigots*: they just weren't specifically thinking in terms of systemic oppression.

Ignore anyone who cares that the movement includes oppressed groups, without making them A Thing. Feature these people without specifically calling out that they MUST be featured. Get the difference? Don't let them think that they're being pushed out by our presence: they're being brought in #withallworkers against the ruling class.
