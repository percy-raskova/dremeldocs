# t find a single primary source attesting to the so-called 

@Cherrykickstart I can't find a single primary source attesting to the so-called "secret protocol" prior to liquidationists "declassifying" it during the final days of the USSR. Not even Nazis facing trial at Nuremberg mentioned it. The most pernicious Cold War era propaganda never insinuated it. @Cherrykickstart The war diary of Franz Halder, who led the Nazis' Polish campaign very clearly lays out his surprise and frustration at the Soviets showing up and preventing them from bulldozing the whole of Poland. He called the "Heroes of Lviv" and had to warn troops not to risk engaging them.
