# political violence

Reminder that the rulers of this country have been committing political violence against *us* the entire time. People can only be pushed so far before they act in (perceived) self-defense.

https://t.co/iTu66su5KE It should be a source of utter despair just how many people perceive nonsense things (like Trump losing an election or vaccine mandates) as an existential threat, compared to the people willing to defend themselves against actual, material harm.
