# t buy poppers because they

Remember when, a year into the pandemic, the FDA issued a warning that people shouldn't buy poppers because they'd seen an increase in deaths and hospitalizations among users?

They cited: increase in body temperature, difficulty breathing, extreme drops in blood oxygen, etc. Basically what I'm hypothesizing is that doing poppers while you have COVID (possibly even asymptomatic COVID) predictably causes all sorts of cardiovascular issues, and the FDA completely ignored this line of inquiry when making their recommendations.
