# m currently in the process of becoming a 

I'm currently in the process of becoming a "class traitor" by purchasing a home.

Mortgage is often cheaper than rent. Yet they adeptly manage to gatekeep membership in this institutional Smart Savers Club based on various markers to determine and engender allegiance to capital. Don't just READ about the intersection of housing and settler colonialism: help fight back! Systemic resistance is being built as we speak. This isn't just "liberal charity," it's one small aspect of materially shifting the landscape.

https://t.co/pEzG2exAED Upfront requirements are astonishing: down payment, real estate agent fee, title, insurance, title insurance (they have to be making this shit up ðŸ™„), inspection, earnest money, furnishing, repairs, and of course "creditworthiness," which is explicitly "usefulness to capital." Homeownership generates equity for yourself, instead of running yet another treadmill of constant survival costs that get used up and need to be replenished through wage labor. It materially vests a subset of the working class into the general wellbeing of the capitalist system. Through myriad pathways, homeownership acts as one of the primary vectors for reinforcing bourgeois hegemony, both on a material basis and a superstructural one. It filters out those deemed too destabilizing to assimilate into the ranks of this imperialist settler garrison. Nevertheless, this paradigm is collapsing. The metrics for filtering and the mechanisms for reinforcing are both failing to reconcile the steadily degrading economic base they are designed to defend. The garrison is under assault, and the illusion of invulnerability is fading. Obviously, this doesn't mean the empire, the settler colonial enterprise, or capitalism itself is "done for." This is simply a crack in the phalanx's defenses, one that can only be widened through deliberate, coordinated assault. As of right now, we don't have that. Given leeway, capitalism has always found ways to innovate patches for its cracks. For over a century, the "Western Left" has given it that leeway. An endless cycle of failing to take advantage of the cracks, replaced with eagerness to economize and integrate into that garrison. The settler mindset has so thoroughly pervaded the broad current of so-called "Marxists," who can scarcely even begin imagining the real forces governing the property relations they "oppose." Instead, they take as given that their purpose is to take ownership of the garrison. This is the primary reason the west as a whole has continued its extractive, exploitative, genocidal, ecocidal project largely unabated for so long. The unshakeable lure of a facile "liberated settler colonialism" has held back the revolutionary potential of the mass of settlers.
