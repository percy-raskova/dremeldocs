# Let me put this in terms liberals will understand: prayer...

Let me put this in terms liberals will understand: prayer is traumatic for me.

I grew up in a hyper-religious community and attended a hyper-religious school. We were expected to spend HOURS every day praying. Tardiness, absence, and just not being spirited enough was punished. https://t.co/PHYyBbnY3Y I was literally suspended for not attending morning prayers at my school.

When I skipped Sabbath morning prayers, my parents took away privileges, spanked me, had me kneel with my hands behind my head and my nose touching the wall.

Religion traumatized me. There is absolutely no context in which I will EVER feel included, welcome or safe when religion is involved. I don't care how "non-denominational." If you think there is any religion-infused ceremony that has "universal appeal," you are suffering from a profound lack of empathy.
