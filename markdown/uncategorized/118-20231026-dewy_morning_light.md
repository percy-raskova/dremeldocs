# dewy morning light

Song of the Martyr:

I saw two birds before me
I saw two birds take flight
I saw their feathers glistening,
In dewy morning light

Their names were Wrath and Vengeance
Their names were Love and Truth
I heard them as they called away
The mournful cry of youth I saw three walls around me
I saw three shadows tall
Behind me churned the gleaming sea
And soon the sky will fall

The golden glare has found me
The white and dust and flame
The roaring silence beckoning
And swallowing my name I see two birds before me
I see them land at last
I hear them add my name to theirs
For now my time is passed
