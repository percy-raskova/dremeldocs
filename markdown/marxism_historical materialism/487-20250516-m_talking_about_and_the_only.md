# m talking about, and the only 

Imperial superprofits and class strata are exactly what I'm talking about, and the only "moral judgement" is on Marxists who refuse to engage with that concept, not with members of the labor aristocracy itself. https://t.co/Y1sMuhC3UQ I've said it many many times: anyone -- of any class -- is absolutely capable of being a revolutionary. You're just less likely to *want* to do that.

If you think "the labor aristocracy benefits from imperialism" is a moral judgement on you, that says more about *you*.
