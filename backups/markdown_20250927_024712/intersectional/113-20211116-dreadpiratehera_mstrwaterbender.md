# @dreadpiratehera @MstrWaterbender

@dreadpiratehera @MstrWaterbender @carterforva Not really. You don't have to *actually* be moderate on social issues. Just run on massively popular economic issues, exclusively talk about that, ignore all bait to engage with "the culture war," and then quietly pass legislation that advances social issues anyway. @dreadpiratehera @MstrWaterbender @carterforva If some jabroni tries to challenge you over your vote for abortion protection, you can just be like "And where do *you* stand on the living wage? Do you think it was bad that I got $25/hr into the pockets of my constituents?"
