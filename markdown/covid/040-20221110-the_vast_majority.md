# the vast majority

@bmore_radical Because the vast majority of people do not know the science, since "official" sources are lying to them. They have not been adequately informed of how aerosol transmission works, the difference between mask grades, or why it is so critical to avoid getting infected. @bmore_radical The people most likely to wear a high grade respirator are the ones who either are "high-risk" or know someone who is. The rest haven't been informed that, by getting infected, you *become* high risk. They have been explicitly told not to worry, as long as they're vaccinated. @bmore_radical Most people don't fully grasp the implications of viral evolution, the effects the virus has on immune systems, or the cumulative damage wreaked on all your organ systems. They don't know what the true case rate is or how that is related to excess deaths months down the line.
