# pure enlightenment

@ParacelsusII The moment the rabbi circumcized me was like achieving pure enlightenment. All the studying of Marxist literature and scientific studies I've done since then has had nothing on the sheer revelatory power of my Jewishness. @ParacelsusII (I feel the need to point out that this person clearly put "BIPOC and Jewish" together because she herself is Jewish, and wanted to portray that identity as having an equivalent unimpeachability.)
