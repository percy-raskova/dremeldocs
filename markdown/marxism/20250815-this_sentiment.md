# This sentiment

This sentiment is what I always caution revolutionaries about when they want to do entryism. You either find yourself ostracized for being too far outside the liberal center of mass, or you make it your mission to prove you are "reasonable" and not a threat to that status quo. https://t.co/FR78l5t9tF You are playing tug-of-war with a cohort that is tethered to the immovable iron rod of bourgeois hegemony. It doesn't matter how strong you are -- you will either lose your grip, be pulled to the right, or the rope will snap. If you *want* it to snap, and all you're trying to do is convince others to join you so they'll be on your side when it does, then fine. That *could* work. But obviously you can't say that. So you're playing this game without explaining it to your teammates. In the meantime, you have to spend all your energy tugging, to the detriment of anything productive. If this is the only recruitment strategy you can think of, you're thinking small. And at the end of it, you don't even have a place for the people you recruit to go.
