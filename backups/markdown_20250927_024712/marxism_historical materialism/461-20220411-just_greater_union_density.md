# just greater union density

As a class, we workers need more than just greater union density. The structure of organized labor also needs substructure and superstructure.

The substructure is the activism and networks of rank-and-file members. The superstructure is the cooperation of union federations. Superstructure is important for coordination of tactics, solidarity actions, setting priorities, and putting boots on the ground. It is crucial for multiplying our efforts, making sure that all of our fights get escalated and executed to the maximum level. Sufficiently advanced union federations across industries and trades can direct and support all members of the working class. They could provide massive strike funds, fill out pickets, train organizers, dictate legislation, support displaced workers, and more. Substructure is crucial as the engine of the labor movement. Workers who are deeply engaged, know each other, highly trained organizers, and most importantly, have endless contingency plans in place. Expect capital to constantly undermine us, and be ready to rebuff and rebuild. The ability of an empowered substructure to constantly reengage rank-and-file workers, even without the legal entity of a union is of utmost importance.

A powerful labor movement needs to be able to ignore blatantly anti-union laws, such as prohibition against sympathy strikes. This means if a union is decertified for violating unjust regulations, its former members need to be ready to jump in and form a union again. They need to be capable of wildcat strikes, in which workers are protected not by legal stricture, but by economic sway over the boss. Without these substructures and superstructures in place, unions naturally default to the service model: negotiating contracts, filing grievances, and slowly hemorrhaging disaffected members. When "demands" aren't met, these unions have no recourse to offer their members. So how do we rebuild these crucial elements of the movement?

On an individual level, that means YOU getting as engaged as possible in your union, with your coworkers, with everyone you know. As someone who understands the struggle we face, it really is your job, and all of ours!
