# The left

"The left" isn't about having nice things, it's about survival. It's not about having the right vibes, it's about being committed to liberation. It's not about your personal feelings of aggrievement over being asked to take sensible safety measures, it's about scientific reality. https://t.co/bas7G0w0m5 How you think about COVID (or if you even do at all) has become one of the easiest litmus tests for revolutionary potential available to us.

Do you have the ability to see past propaganda, even when it's hegemonic? Can you be convinced to care about the health of the people? Do you see yourself as invincible? Have you learned to accept suffering so reflexively that you don't even recognize it? Are you more swayed by the lure of normalcy and endless consumption than the promise of building a better world? Will you ever be willing to truly struggle?
