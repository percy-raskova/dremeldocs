# an omniscient, omnipotent god

@Leo52846989 At 14, I realized it was impossible for there to be an omniscient, omnipotent god, because he either:

- Knows everything that will ever happen, and is therefore powerless to change it, or
- *can* change the events he knew in advance, in which case he didn't actually know it. @Leo52846989 After that, it all started unraveling pretty quickly. Still took me until I was 16 to realize "Wait, if an infallible deity *didn't* promise Israel to us for all eternity, doesn't that mean Zionism is evil? ðŸ¤”"
