# just a little oopsie

Ohhh, ok. It was just a little oopsie. A room full of the most powerful politicians in Canada all did a whoops, and forgot what it means to have "fought against Russia in WWII." 338 lawmakers, each making little boo-boos. https://t.co/cgsymLrEKw Do they honestly expect anyone to believe that *Zelensky* didn't know who this person was? And if he somehow didn't know that this "national hero" was a Nazi, that doesn't exactly do much to combat the notion that Ukraine has a Nazi problem.
