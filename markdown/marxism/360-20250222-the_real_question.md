# the real question

@matrixmarxist I think the real question is actually what would happen immediately before and after it made impact. Pretty sure it would be leaving behind a straight line of superheated air, stripping away electrons and creating plasma. It would basically turn into a bolt of lightning. @matrixmarxist 2.6 billion joules is about the energy you would expect in a naturally occuring lightning bolt -- but that's what the ant has when it *hits* you. If it had been traveling for a while before that, it must have had a lot more energy to start.
