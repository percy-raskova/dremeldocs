# @MatthewBarba4 @katewillett

@MatthewBarba4 @katewillett The system that "artificially" constricts housing supply is free market capitalism. Corporations don't build homes that they can't make the maximum profit from. If they do, they lose market share to the more ruthless corporations and go out of business. @MatthewBarba4 @katewillett At which point those more profitable corporations proceed to buy up the assets and raise prices.
