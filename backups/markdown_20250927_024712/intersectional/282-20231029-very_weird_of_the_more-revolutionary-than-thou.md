# Very weird of the "more-revolutionary-than-thou" types to...

Very weird of the "more-revolutionary-than-thou" types to call protesting pointless. Meanwhile, the Palestinian resistance has explicitly put out messages saying "Yes, we see you demonstrating, and we applaud your solidarity! Keep it up, and escalate the pressure!" Don't *stop* at marches, obviously. Use them as platforms. Bring politically-underdeveloped attendees into your organizations. Use the anger and energy to radicalize, educate, and mobilize. Swell your ranks and escalate your tactics. It would be fantastic if these large "communist" and "socialist" organizations in the West would coordinate mass action. Create guides and logistical frameworks to drive productive escalation for locals. It would be great if we had an actual, organized movement. But for now, just listen to resistance about what they want from us. FOCUS ON THE EMBASSIES AND MILITARY BASES. That is what we have explicitly been asked to do.
