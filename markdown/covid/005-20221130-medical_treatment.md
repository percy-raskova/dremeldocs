# medical treatment

@predederva They believe that homosexuals will "gods' first target of annihilation," that "The way alien beings get human beings to shake free of the gods is to mix the races," and crucially, encourages members not to seek medical treatment.

https://t.co/9r0jHgZz7t @predederva They don't consider themselves a religion, but a "practice." Their media (Epoch Times and New Tang Dynasty) churns out a constant stream of far right editorials, including various pro-Trump conspiracy theories, COVID misinformation, and racially-charged immigration fearmongering. @predederva To characterize them as a far-right cult is not the sole purview of the CPC, but numerous mainstream, western sources.
