# s performative is the liberal notion of reaching out to...

Being crystal clear about the fact that you are not part of a vague ideological morass that encompasses liberalism makes you... a liberal?

What's performative is the liberal notion of reaching out to ideological enemies to find some sort of "compromise." https://t.co/TiKbsJatDb If you're a communist trying to "pull liberals in," you will always either end up frustrated, endlessly banging your head against the wall of liberal obstinance... or becoming part of that wall yourself.

I promise you, they don't love you like that.
