# fast food workers

@marwilliamson @HtotheJsquared Neither of them are teachers, plumbers, fast food workers, sex workers, sanitation workers, or any of the other things that America looks like. @marwilliamson @HtotheJsquared Have either of them ever even paid rent? Had a panic attack over a hundred dollar expense? Tolerated rampant abuse from their employer because getting fired would ruin their lives?
