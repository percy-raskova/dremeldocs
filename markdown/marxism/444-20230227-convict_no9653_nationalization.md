# @Convict_No9653 Nationalization

@Convict_No9653 Nationalization of industry and social programs are good, just... not socialism. In the global south, they are outgrowths of national liberation, and crucially, degrade imperialism -- which is critical for defeating capitalism. Hence the violence wrought on countries that try it. @Convict_No9653 They are categorically different from European social democracy, which *relies* on imperialism and *defends* capitalism.
