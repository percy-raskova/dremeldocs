# The Wexner Foundation

The Wexner Foundation -- a Zionist non-profit, founded by billionaires Lex and Abigail Wexner -- is cutting ties with Harvard over their unwillingness to name and blacklist students who signed onto a letter condemning the occupation. https://t.co/3z0s3etQIi (The rambling letter is far too long for alt text, so for accessibility, I have transcribed it in full here: https://t.co/srU05dCYit) The overwrought, aggrieved tone of this letter is not just something to mock for its self-contradiction -- namely appealing to the value of "respecting diverse perspectives," while explicitly decrying Harvard for not taking an unambiguous stance AGAINST a different perspective. Rather, this letter and the divestment it proclaims is emblematic of the sinister rhetorical and economic tools of revanchist fascist organizing. Those with extant social, political, and economic power naturally use that power to reinforce the social relations that empower them. They perceive their preeminence as natural, moral, and unshakeable. When they detect even a whiff of mobilization against that hegemonic rule, whether in the form of liberation movements or rival bourgeois camps, they (correctly) recognize that their power is not unassailable. And so, they become more aggressive in using their economic and social heft to punish dissent. They don't just whine about how unfair it is that they are being challenged: they withdraw funds, they launch media campaigns, they fund revanchist political movements. They even employ outright political violence. One of the primary avenues for this is, of course, police action: claims of disrupting the peace, danger to property, or targeted enforcement of petty crimes. They may or may not also directly recruit extrajudicial violence. The funding of terrorist organizations by bourgeois revanchists is often more subtle, and less common in the modern iteration of fascism. However, they have found a much better, more "respectable" way of accomplishing this task, through the funding of "education" efforts. The revanchists have crafted a mind-bogglingly vast network of radicalization outlets, from Prager U to Daily Wire to various think tanks to non-profits to "independent" online influencers. All of these are oriented toward fostering fascist political mobilization. The reason the Wexner Foundation and several other capitalists have called for the naming of the students who signed onto the anti-zionist letter is to turn them into "legitimate targets." These students would be targeted for harassment, economic harm, and physical violence. It's not that they are mere hypocrites, unable to see that "diversity of perspectives" goes both ways. It's that they don't want diversity -- they want to maintain their hegemony. And they enforce it with terror. Economic, political, and yes, even physical terror.
