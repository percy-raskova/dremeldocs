# the explicit point

@RealGayArbys This was the explicit point of so much of the propaganda: get people to the point where they believe that disease is inevitable, so even if you cognitively understand the full extent of the damage, you feel like trying to avoid it is just wasting what time you have left. @RealGayArbys It's the same dynamic with climate change, war, poverty, *everything* awful in society. They can't sufficiently convince us that bad things are good, so they inject a constant stream of hopelessness and "live for the now" ideology to preempt revolutionary optimism.
