# Specifically, the function of the party is to reproduce...

Specifically, the function of the party is to reproduce cadres, using existing cadres. If you're starting with shit, you're only ever going to reproduce shit. If we see the shit you're producing, we know they came from shit, and we know to predict still more shit down the line. https://t.co/c6UM3WBQQn If you think the shit you're producing is an exception, and that your starting cells could do better, that means you need to understand that your *reproduction* is the problem. But more often than not, the reproduction is shit because it was put in place by shit founders.
