There is not a vote you can cast that will save Black, immigrant, woman, and LGBTQ lives in America. There just isn't. We will have to use other means for that. https://t.co/N2Z3wdxyrK Whenever you go a single question deeper into this "analysis," and ask what, *exactly* is the plan for "saving" oppressed peoples, the answer is always "Trump would be worse." Worse than what? Worse than the persecution we've been seeing for years, that has only ever accelerated?
