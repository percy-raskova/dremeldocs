# @VancouverGordo Did you even read the source for this

@VancouverGordo Did you even read the source for this? It demonstrates what I just said about antigenic distance. They test the cross-neutralization for BA.4/5 serum against XBB.1.5, and find that it evades BA.4/5 immunity -- hence the need for this update that *no one* has yet. @VancouverGordo They did *not* test the cross-neutralization of the XBB.1.5 booster against any of the subvariants from that lineage, despite the ancestral XBB.1.5 strain having receded to less than 5% of cases. They just said "We don't think there should be any problem." No data, just vibes.
