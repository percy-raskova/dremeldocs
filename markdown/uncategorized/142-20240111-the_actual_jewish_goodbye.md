# the actual Jewish goodbye

Ok but the actual Jewish goodbye is when you never actually leave, because your hosts intentionally refuse to acknowledge the many, many hints you're dropping that you would like to go home now.

If you don't have a specific, scheduled engagement planned, you are trapped forever. https://t.co/WlPDxn8btS I arrive with 2 full Tupperware containers to repay my hosts for the last time, when they sent me home with leftovers.

6 hours later, I am somehow leaving with 3 full containers.
