# @jewstein3000 "Mild" just means "didn't go to a hospital...

@jewstein3000 "Mild" just means "didn't go to a hospital during the acute phase."

So if someone doesn't go to a hospital because they're afraid to be saddled with medical bills, or because they know there are no beds, or because they're "toughing it out" to avoid having to miss work... @jewstein3000 And of course, that's all *acute*. "Mild" doesn't count anything that happens after the infection itself passes. We've known for a long time that COVID's severity almost always comes down to damage done by the immune response itself, which can persist for a loooong time. @jewstein3000 Even though co-infection is not considered a significant factor in COVID deaths, opportunistic infections after "recovery" could still be a major concern. @jewstein3000 (obviously I'm not trying to educate *you* on this, I'm just trying to lend additional support)
