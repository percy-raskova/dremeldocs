# internal distribution

@throwaway285601 None of this is about internal distribution. When I say "these are your people," I'm talking about the entire community, only a fraction of whom will ever be cadre. Member or not, we work for the liberation of all oppressed people. @throwaway285601 As far as how this builds revolution, I'm writing an entire book on the subject. It's not something that can be summed up in a Twitter thread.

The short answer is that the medium-term goal is to put as much production as possible into the hands of a working class vanguard.
