# ll probably write up something more comprehensive soon, but...

@Punk_Boricua I'll probably write up something more comprehensive soon, but the short answer is that the broad "left liberal" reaction to AI is... reactionary. Lots of really vitriolic rhetoric, people taking offense at the very concept of "soulless robots infringing on pure natural humanity." @Punk_Boricua There are certainly *actual* criticisms to make, just like with any technological innovation under capitalism. But those criticisms don't include "This is gross," "This isn't REAL art," "Anyone who uses AI art is an enemy of the human race," etc. @Punk_Boricua And arguments that reify "intellectual property" are just as regressive as arguments reifying private property. Communists don't need to shed a tear for the vast array of small business owners constantly getting proletarianized as capital concentrates production.
