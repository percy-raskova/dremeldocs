# Communist Party of [Imperialist Entity]

@ScottishCommie There is an entire international ecosystem of "Communist Party of [Imperialist Entity]," that refuse to even grapple with the notion that these states are illegitimate at their root. May as well be Communist Party of Rhodesia ðŸ™„ @ScottishCommie Tbh, this is the strongest case to be made by ultraleftists that existing socialist states are revisionist, imperialist, etc.: The pro-imperialism parties are the ones formally recognized by AES parties.

Not that I really subscribe to that line of thinking.
