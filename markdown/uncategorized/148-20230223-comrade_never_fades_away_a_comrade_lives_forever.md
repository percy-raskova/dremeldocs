# comrade never fades away , A comrade lives forever 

A comrade never fades away,
A comrade lives forever.
For though the body may decay,
The bond cannot be severed.
A comrade never fails to breathe;
Their voice is ours, unbroken.
Their struggle and their surety,
They live through words they've spoken. A comrade's earthly reach extends
Beyond their mortal tether.
A comrade never dies, my friends,
For struggle lasts forever.
