# at least those

We're all sick of the pandemic (at least those of us who still acknowledge it). Wearing a mask everywhere is exhausting, declining social events that aren't--or can't be--COVID safe feels alienating, and every reminder that things aren't "normal" creates mental strain. A key thing to remember is that it gets easier the more the people in your circle take it seriously. Remember the early-pandemic concept of "bubbles"? If I know that someone is being *truly* safe, I won't hesitate to spend time with them--and I let people know that. I'm comfortable being indoors and unmasked with someone who I know doesn't make a habit of doing that with "unsafe" people. Yes, that means you don't go to restaurants, bars, etc. I can't control what other people see as "acceptable risk," but I can use it to assess my OWN risk.
