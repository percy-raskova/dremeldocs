# an obscene amount

It takes me an obscene amount of energy to deliberately and consciously navigate social interactions. And sometimes I do it so seamlessly that I fool everyone including myself. But the mask is heavy and uncomfortable if I wear it too long. It's a chore and I grow to resent people for making me do it. Even though I like people. I really do. I think people are fascinating and weird and important and cute and inspiring and my entire reason for existence. And also people are exhausting and should really shut up. And people grow to resent me for not always having the energy to remember how to play the game their way. Because to them, it's not even a game, it's just the way you are, automatically, no need to think. Or they blame me FOR remembering, because I remember better than them and that's weird and obsessive and means I'm trying to "beat them" at something. So now, suddenly it IS a game again, and by trying to "win," I'm a scumbag loser. I've been yelled at for everything you can possibly imagine. I need to speak up. I need to quiet down. Look people in the eyes. No, not like that, stop staring, weirdo. I can't believe you forgot, don't you pay attention? You remembered that? That's really creepy.

EXHAUSTING It gets all jumbled up in a complex web of emotions. Because I remember ALL of it. Every negative interaction sticks with me. And also every positive one. And I get tons of praise too! And the praise usually contradicts the scorn, and makes me think people are just being unfair. Sorry for rambling. I'm not supposed to do that either, right? Oh, but I'm also supposed to be honest (but not too honest) and trust people (but not expect them to trust me) and not just hide away from the world (but also shut up, no one wants to hear about that). I've been accused of being condescending, and also acclaimed for my ability to convey complex topics in a easily-digestible way, without talking down to people. I've been yelled at for acting like I know everything -- and also been the first place people turn to for answers. Thanks for the praise, I guess. But also fuck you, because it would be emotionally easier to just believe the scorn and not have to try to be anything more than a fuckup. Not being a fuckup is a lot of pressure when you know deep down that you actually are (and also aren't).
