# VPNs are legal and very common in China

VPNs are legal and very common in China. The only exception is VPNs that don't allow backdoors for monitoring illegal activity -- which is also the policy in the US, Europe, etc.

Chinese people are totally free to browse Wikipedia, Google, Twitter, etc. https://t.co/wQ8IlYpTSv The concept of government's requiring backdoors should be familiar to you, considering that that is the EXACT reason TikTok is being banned by the US government. The US and EU also constantly play whack-a-mole with VPNs that skirt these "security regulations." When my Swedish friend sent me a video of a Eurovision performance, I couldn't access it until I used a VPN with a European IP address. I didn't "break the law" or "bravely evade censorship." I just... got around region-locked content restrictions. This is not complicated.
