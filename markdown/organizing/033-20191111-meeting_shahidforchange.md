# meeting @ShahidForChange

I had the pleasure of meeting @ShahidForChange today in DC. I can attest to the fact that he is NOT one of those mainstream progressives latching on to the "democratic socialist" label because it's gaining momentum. This fight has been his life since I was in grade school. Also, he's just a legitimately kind person, and organizing is his native language. Even during his own event, all he could think of was trying to connect people to each other!
