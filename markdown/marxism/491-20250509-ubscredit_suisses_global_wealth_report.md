# UBS/Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Report

@MazovianMan My source for a lot of this data is UBS/Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Report (and specifically the more granular data in its Global Wealth Databook). They put the top ten threshold at 137,333 USD.

The $1 million cutoff is for the top 1%. @MazovianMan Note that my numbers for each country's share of the top ten are different from theirs, because I did my own estimations to figure out how to include dependents in population figures, not just individual wealth-holding adults. To me, that's a crucial component of class dynamics.
