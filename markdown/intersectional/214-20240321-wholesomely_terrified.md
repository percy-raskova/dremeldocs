# wholesomely terrified

@DecolonialMarx Oh, yes, I misunderstood what specifically you were getting at with "wholesomely terrified." In trans circles, I've heard people refer to "ewphoria" ðŸ˜…

I actually do have a chapter planned in my book on liberalism and fascism that could shed some light on this! @DecolonialMarx To oversimplify, liberalism relies heavily on crafting socially stratified identities: sometimes explicitly, sometimes more implicit to the economic functioning of capitalism and colonialism. The nature of bourgeois culture naturalizes and obfuscates these social relations... @DecolonialMarx ... and atomizes its subjects to think of their experiences within various cohorts as *individual*, rather than collective. One of the first steps toward, for example, national liberation, is *consciousness* of the nation as an identity that has *already* been thrust upon you. @DecolonialMarx In other words, there is a euphoric sense of belonging that comes with recognizing those social relations that we are already subjected to and which materially dictate our lives. And it's a precondition to overturning these social forces that divide us into classes and subclasses
