# bourgeois and proletarian forces

Let's get this perfectly clear: the ONLY unity between bourgeois and proletarian forces occurs on the basis of the nation.

For oppressed nations, this arrangement forms for the sake of national liberation.

For oppressor nations, it is fascism. https://t.co/LsjG1me3cz Fascism is not an aesthetic. It's not a vibe, where everyone wears black uniforms and rifle-toting police stand at every street corner asking for your papers.

It is a deliberate attempt to subordinate class relations to the material relations of the bourgeois national form. In a sense, it is not "false consciousness," but an active embrace by the masses of the oppressor nation of their extant status as the material beneficiaries of the national system. The falsehood only occurs on the road from a liberatory ideology to one which reifies the nation. The United States, France, the UK, etc. cannot be "defended from fascism" through "uniting with bourgeois forces." There is no third party here. Upholding these national constructs in and of themselves *is* what empowers the already existing fascism on which they are built.
