# s absolutely something I

@Dr_Marxist_27 This is definitely an important conversation to be had, and it's absolutely something I've thought about a lot. In my experience, it's a very tough sell to a lot of working class people -- not even just the labor aristocrats snootily looking down at the "unsavory criminals." @Dr_Marxist_27 But that's not a reason *not* to pursue it. There just needs to be caution, diplomacy, and oodles of education. I think communities can definitely come to embrace whichever gangs can come to take on a more revolutionary role.
