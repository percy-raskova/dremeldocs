# the deep alienation

Some thoughts on the deep alienation drilled into us by the world we all feel trapped in. This is NOT a feel-good poem.

The toothy grin of Capital
Will say you are alone
It digs it in and says you're all
Alone
Alone
Alone.
Your worth is all your own, you work
Alone
Alone
Alone. Your hands to me have value
You must work them to the
Bone.
You have no land, no comrades
You live and pray
Alone.
Your mind, your heart, your values all
Alone
Alone
Alone.
Your struggle has no meaning here
So muddle through
Alone. If only you could build yourself
Alone
Alone
Alone.
And all alone, you'd make your way
Alone
Alone
Alone.
If you feel lost or scared or soft
Just know you are
Alone.
So guard yourself and box it in
Leave others all
Alone. Their struggles are not yours, they are
Alone
Alone
Alone.
They hate you for the strength you built
Alone
Alone
Alone.
So take your life in your own hands
And hold it all
Alone.
And if you can, you'll take theirs too
Before you die
Alone.
