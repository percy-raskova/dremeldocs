# m not calling 

@femalehysteria @fugalise I'm not calling "liberal" the most opposed to working within DSA -- quite the opposite. The impulse to triangulate a "broad-based coalition" by entreating the membership of a fundamentally reformist parent organization is a vestigial value instilled by hegemonic liberalism. @femalehysteria @fugalise I'm also not trying to ignore all the nuance among the positions held by a diverse membership. There is a great deal of eclecticism and syncretism, which itself is a sign of ideological underdevelopment. Which is, again, totally understandable at this stage, not disqualifying.
