# South America

The path I see for revolution in the imperial core runs through Africa and South America. Liberation of the colonial base of modern imperialism cuts off the flow of material resources needed to buy compliance. The U.S. is already doing a terrible job of distributing the spoils. https://t.co/d19HYniqB5 As the targets of imperialism shake off the chains of colonial rule, the plenitude of cheap consumer goods in the core declines. The falling rate of profit spirals even faster, and exploitation of workers here accelerates, exposing the inherent contradictions of the system. By the same token, the success of revolution in the periphery relies on internal pressure placed on the empire at home (and of course, direct material support). We're all part of the same feedback loop. Internationalism is not just moral, but *inseparable* from revolution. The mass of people who cannot afford basic necessities will skyrocket. If communists have already been doing the work of building organizational infrastructure to fold in an expanding base of desperate workers, revolution becomes inevitable. If not... fascism. The question of "revolutionary potential" itself fails to see the world in motion. Revolution is a positive feedback loop, where potential is *built* through the process of doing revolutionary organizing. That organizing needs to keep pace with the decline in material conditions. This requires us to conceptualize each necessary step of the decline of empire, use what we already have to meet the moment, and expand our organizational capacity. We have neither the luxury of hope nor hopelessness.
