# s not 

It's not "just thirty days" any more than waterboarding is "just 20 seconds."

If you don't relent after the first time, they do it again. That's 30 day sessions of brutal abuse by fascist COs who can't wait to get their hands on "traitors."

Now add on the fact that she's trans. https://t.co/4KLEcqL7Ie "This is the bare minimum!" Sure, and the bare minimum for you is... protesting? Calling your representative? Not eating McDonald's?

You bear exactly as much responsibility for this genocide as these kids do, and you sacrifice nothing in the name of your "opposition."
