# the consistent medical gaslighting

@pigeon_pretty I know you're trying to be helpful, so I will say this as kindly as possible: this is completely incorrect, and is exactly what I was referring to when I mentioned the consistent medical gaslighting that causes (intentionally or not) worse patient outcomes. @pigeon_pretty The psychosomatic hypothesis for CFS has been tested for over 50 years and thoroughly debunked. The persistence of this myth -- especially among clinicians who haven't kept up with the science -- has been incredibly harmful for people with CFS. @pigeon_pretty "CFS" is a broad term that refers to a specific category of disease *presentation*, but with a wide variety of known and unknown etiologies. Its emergence following viral (more so than bacterial) infection is so common that it is designated its own subcategory. @pigeon_pretty Among the ways we know it is not psychosomatic comes in the form of an astonishing array of biochemical studies that have investigated metabolic, immunologic, neurologic, and other physiological pathways, finding significant divergences from the healthy population. @pigeon_pretty Stress does not cause a concomitant rise in pro-inflammatory markers and sharp decline in levels of hypoxanthine, or heightened excretion of methylhistidine, mannitol, and acetate. These are metabolic factors: an inability to extract energy from glucose and breaking down muscles. @pigeon_pretty I could go into endless detail on this, but the executive summary is this: it is absolutely not helpful to psychologize a biochemical condition. You cannot mindfulness your way out of it any more than you could with diabetes or starvation.
