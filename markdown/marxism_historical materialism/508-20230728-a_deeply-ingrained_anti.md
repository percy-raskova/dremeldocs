# a deeply-ingrained anti

@m1vql1hdwt I believe it comes from a deeply-ingrained anti-communism, in which western leftists have felt the need to uncritically accept that all existing socialism up to this point has been "repressive" and "a failure."

i.e. "Stalin was bad, but we want a DIFFERENT socialism!" @m1vql1hdwt And obviously an overwhelming desire to not reckon with themselves as the beneficiaries of imperialism or establish an economic system that liberates the entire world. "Bill of rights socialism," where slave labor in the global south still provides all the chocolate we "deserve."
