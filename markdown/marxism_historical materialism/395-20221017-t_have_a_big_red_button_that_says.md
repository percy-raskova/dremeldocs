# t have a big red button that says 

@SherylWeikalLaw Well yes, I was being hyperbolic. We also don't have a big red button that says "Undo climate change" that we can press if we just get the capitalists out of our way. The point is more that defeating capitalism is an inherent part of solving all these problems *and vice versa*. @SherylWeikalLaw A socialism that doesn't eliminate bigotry will NEVER progress to a stateless, classless, propertyless society. With race as an example, it would be almost laughably easy for fascists to seize on lingering "racial resentment" to undo any progress we make.
