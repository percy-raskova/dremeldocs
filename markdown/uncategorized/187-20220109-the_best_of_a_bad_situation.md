# the best of a bad situation

I want everyone to understand that this is not "normal" or "the best of a bad situation" or "inevitable."

China has been disproving that narrative every step of the way. Their response hasn't been perfect, but they have shown what's possible when you put people over money. And by the way, even with all the horrifying missteps, it's *still* not a lost cause. A sharp, immediate course correction can still save a million lives. It's going to be much harder than it could have been a year ago. Hard, but not impossible.
