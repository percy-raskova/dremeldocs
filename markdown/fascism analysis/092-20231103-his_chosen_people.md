# his chosen people

In the Tanakh, the enemies of Yahweh and his chosen people are often presented as giants. During the time of the great flood, the people who got drowned were supposedly giants, one of whom, Og, survived by clinging to Noah's ark, living all the way until getting killed by Moses. https://t.co/92MYXuL8qo When the Jews were traveling from Egypt to the promised land, they sent spies in ahead of them to scout the enemies (the indigenous peoples of Canaan, whom Yahweh commanded them to slaughter). The spies returned with giant fruits and tales of giant inhabitants. The Jews freaked out at the thought of facing down such monstrous enemies, and Yahweh got angry with them for doubting that he could deliver the land to them. As punishment, they were told to wander around the Sinai desert for 40 years, until everyone who complained had died. In the early days of the Israeli monarchy, under King Saul, the Jews faced constant threat from the "Plishtim," AKA Philistines AKA the root word for "Palestine." They were a monstrous people that had to be killed to ensure the security of the Israelis. Among them was, famously, the giant Goliath, who Yahweh helped David kill with a single strike from his sling. Later, David would singlehandedly slaughter 200 Palestinians, circumcise their corpses, and bring back their foreskins as a dowry to marry Saul's daughter. You get the point? Giant, evil, godless monsters, whose only purpose is to destroy what the good, noble children of God try to build, fated to be wiped off the face of the Earth to bring in an age of peace.

Fascist propaganda never changes.
