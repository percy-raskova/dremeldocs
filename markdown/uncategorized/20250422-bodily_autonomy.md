# Bodily autonomy

"Bodily autonomy" does not trump saving lives. If organ donation is not mandatory, you are prioritizing the "autonomy" of dead bodies over the right of living people to continue living. https://t.co/1uUEc3tcNH "But what about religious practices--"

Religious freedom ends at causing harm. There is no difference between believing you will be cosmically punished if your body is "desecrated" and believing you will be punished if you don't sate your god's bloodlust through human sacrifice. If there is a point at which we must stop entertaining the vagaries of "deeply held beliefs," that point is right here, at the infringement of those beliefs on the well-being of others.

"I don't like the thought of my dead body being messed with" is not an innocent preference.
