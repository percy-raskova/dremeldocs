# this garbage website

No matter how much I rail against Twitter, it's still incredible how, through this garbage website, I have been able to connect with fellow communists on every continent except Antarctica.

(At least, as far as I know. Antarctica comrades, hit me up! ðŸ«¡) Also, I haven't exactly sat down to make a list, but my list of mutuals encompasses dozens of languages. That's truly astounding.
