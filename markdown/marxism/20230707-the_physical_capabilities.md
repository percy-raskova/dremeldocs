# the physical capabilities

He's absolutely correct that it might not be possible to prevent 2 degrees of warming. That's because we are fighting against *him* to do so. It is within the physical capabilities of humanity to avert the apocalypse -- and capitalism is doing everything it can to prevent that. https://t.co/Kn0KcjTvg2 The sociopathic way these people discuss biosphere collapse in degrees is nothing short of genocidal. 3 degrees -- which we are on track to easily surpass -- would be orders of magnitude worse, but 2 degrees is still essentially the end of the world as we know it. Crop failure, land loss, soil erosion, destruction of coastal cities, the end of marine agriculture, heat waves, wildfires, and more. Most crucially, the destruction of several key carbon sinks, especially rainforest collapse and the disruption of deep sea carbon sequestration. Mass migration in response to loss of habitable land and food sources will exacerbate geopolitical strain. Even if the entire global north is prepared to absorb all climate migrants (rather than the much more likely fascist acceleration), doing so will trigger further shifts. Land use will become further intensified, even as agricultural conditions continue to spiral. Deforestation will accelerate, depriving us of yet more carbon sequestration. Monoculture will erode soil and fresh water reserves faster. Energy use to keep up will burn yet more carbon Surrendering 2 degrees of warming almost *guarantees* hitting 3 degrees later on, through these biophysical and social feedback loops. And Obama is no fool. None of these capitalists are under any misconception about any of this: they simply do not care. They believe they will continue to rule this apocalyptic hell just as they have for centuries. They are blinded by hubris, and believe nothing can shake their grip on power. We have to prove them wrong NOW, rather than wait for them to gobble up the last of our hope for survival.
