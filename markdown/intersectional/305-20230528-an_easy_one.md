# an easy one

@_RollerGirl_ Thanks!

The question of what to do is not an easy one. The point of articles like this, exposing the way capitalism fundamentally blocks all progress, is to break down the natural impulse to "work within the system." Which necessarily means the solution has to be revolutionary. @_RollerGirl_ It's easy to just go on Twitter and type out "WE NEED A REVOLUTION!" Much harder to actually do that. But the truth is that that's exactly what we have to do. Anything short of that will simply be overridden by the same power structures that got us here to begin with. @_RollerGirl_ Some of the work USU is doing is aimed at guides for how to study revolution, how to form organizations, how to congeal them into a revolution-focused party, etc. In other words, translating centuries of history into a theoretical foundation for our contemporary conditions. @_RollerGirl_ It feels like an unsatisfying answer. But the truth is, there is no *immediate* solution to this, to climate change, to fascism, etc. We need to build a framework through which real change can actually be accomplished. Until we build a boat, we're just treading water.
