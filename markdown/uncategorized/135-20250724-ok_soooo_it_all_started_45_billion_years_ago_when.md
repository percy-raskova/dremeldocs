Ok soooo it all started ~4.5 billion years ago, when a planet called Theia collided with the Earth... https://t.co/nlKtKrYgrN I'm not actually planning to finish this thread because I know the question isn't all that serious, and the answer is based on a complex series of (increasingly validated) hypotheses about mantle dynamics. I remember years ago hearing about these "mysterious, giant regions of hot, dense mantle, but no one knows what they are," and offhandedly going "Oh, I bet they're the remnants of Theia." And every year since then, we've gotten more evidence that that's probably what happened.
