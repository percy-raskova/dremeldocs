# the immediate tasks

Every communist postulating about the immediate tasks of our movement -- to form this or that organization, to launch this or that campaign, etc. -- is dead wrong.

The foremost task for the modern communist movement is to find and smash to dust the servers of JaKKKobin Magazine. https://t.co/upql29SZQM I cannot stress this emphatically enough: "patriotism" of the oppressor nation is the core of fascism. It is categorically different from -- and violently opposed to -- national liberation movements. The sheer GALL to cite the patriotism of the very same bourgeois revolutions that created this oppressor-oppressed national dialectic defies all reason. They then conveniently leave out every example of AES -- the heroic liberation of colonized China, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Korea. This absolute swill is so profoundly evil, I can't even express myself properly. It's 4 in the morning, I'm at the tail end of a hellish night shift, and all I can think about is unleashing the most brutal terror the world has ever seen to drive out every lick of Yankee identity.
