# s been months since I

I feel like it's been months since I've mentioned it, so it bears repeating (even though it's literally my pinned tweet):

COVID is still here.
COVID is not just acute sickness.
COVID causes cumulative damage with every infection.
COVID is worth avoiding. We have less than 5 years of data on the chronic health impacts of COVID. We don't have the full picture, and even the picture we do have is DEVESTATING. It would not be surprising if, a generation from now, it replaces smoking cessation as the most obvious health intervention.
