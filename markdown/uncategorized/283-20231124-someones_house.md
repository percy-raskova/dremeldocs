# someone's house

Someone marches into someone's house, kills most of the inhabitants, chases out the rest, and sets up guards around the property to prevent them from returning.

Then they turn around and rent out rooms of the house. What does that mean for you, the renter? There is an entire contingent of renters who boldly proclaim "This injustice shall not stand! We will defeat the landlord, seize the house for ourselves, and abolish rent!"

When you dare to say "But the house isn't yours either," they act like you just planned their murder. "Where are we supposed to go??"

That's not up to me, is it? Maybe the rightful owners are ok with having you as roommates. Maybe they'll be the ones charging you rent from now on. Maybe you'll need to build your own house.

Just stop acting like the house should belong to you. I can absolutely guarantee that the first scenario is off the table if you keep acting this way, and probably the second. Maybe start acting like a good roommate if that's what you want to be. Otherwise, what's the difference between you and the rest of the guards?
