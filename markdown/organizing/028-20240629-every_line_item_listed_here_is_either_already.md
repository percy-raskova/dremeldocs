# Every line item listed here is either already happening,...

Every line item listed here is either already happening, already in the works, so vague as to be nonsensical, or irrelevant to the goal of liberation. It happens no matter who's in charge, and many of these things are explicitly part of the Democratic Party's governing policy. https://t.co/SRKIvdQcE6 I'm tempted to go line by line, putting sources showing, for example, Obama and Biden both fulfilling "prioritize drilling more fossil fuel" or "mass deportation of immigrants," etc. But that is just a ridiculous waste of energy to spend on people who are never going to get it.
