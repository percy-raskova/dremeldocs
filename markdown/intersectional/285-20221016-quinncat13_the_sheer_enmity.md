# @QuinnCat13 The sheer enmity

@QuinnCat13 The sheer enmity some people have for the working class ðŸ™„

I'm not going to pretend this is "good" other than the fact that it provides nutrients. Really what I feel when I see this is that, in a country that literally leaves food to rot in the field, people still suffer. @QuinnCat13 So much of human culture revolves around making shit work based on what's available. And because the natural world is so bountiful, that process has given us so many delights.

This is the result of "making do" when the world has been stripped away from us, canned, and sold back. @QuinnCat13 And if she likes it and her kids like it, then all the better! But someone like this should be free to do so much more with the spirit of "figure out what works."
