# @ninaturner @AOC @BernieSanders @SenSanders

@RaulTheDirector @ninaturner @AOC @BernieSanders @SenSanders There aren't enough people talking about how Bernie COMPLETELY changed the political conversation in 2016. I would never have started doing my thing if I hadn't suddenly seen every socialist come out of hiding and demand basic human rights. @RaulTheDirector @ninaturner @AOC @BernieSanders @SenSanders @AOC, @RashidaTlaib, @DelegateStewart, @MeetMckayla, @carterforva, and every other political activist I've met or heard of has been driven by their own strength, but that strength would mean nothing if there hadn't been this surge of goodwill toward leftist politics. @RaulTheDirector @ninaturner @AOC @BernieSanders @SenSanders @RashidaTlaib @DelegateStewart @MeetMckayla @carterforva 2016 wasn't the beginning, but it was a culmination of a long-simmering dissatisfaction that manifested in a sitting congress member with decades of stalwart activism finally screaming loud enough for people to hear. 2018 was HUGE. 2020 and 2022 are shaping up to be even huger.
