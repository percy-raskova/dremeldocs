# wonder if that girl who painted my nails during WormFest...

I wonder if that girl who painted my nails during WormFest knows the impact she had ðŸ¤” https://t.co/kVpus1U17Q Yes, I once willingly attended a convention of nematode researchers, and I kinda had a blast tbh. Those worm people know how to get freaky. The booze was flowing, my nails were sparkling, and I hadn't yet internalized the emotional abuse my PI was intentionally wreaking on me ðŸ¥°
