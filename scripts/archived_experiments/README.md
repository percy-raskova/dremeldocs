# Archived Experimental Scripts

These scripts represent alternative approaches to theme extraction and vocabulary building that were explored during development. They've been consolidated into the main pipeline but preserved here for reference and potential future use.

## Consolidated into `vocabulary_builder.py`

### build_political_vocabulary.py
- **Purpose**: Build YAML vocabularies from corpus analysis
- **Features**: Term variations, quality filtering, statistical analysis
- **Status**: Functionality merged into VocabularyBuilder class

### extract_domain_vocabulary.py
- **Purpose**: Extract political/Marxist vocabulary using regex patterns
- **Features**: Pattern-based extraction for class analysis, dialectics, organizing, imperialism
- **Status**: Patterns integrated into PoliticalVocabularyExtractor class

### generate_themes_from_tags.py
- **Purpose**: Auto-generate themes from tag frequency analysis
- **Features**: Statistical theme generation based on tag co-occurrence
- **Status**: Concepts incorporated into vocabulary scoring methods

## Enhanced Features Added to `theme_classifier.py`

### enhanced_theme_classifier.py
- **Purpose**: More sophisticated theme classification
- **Features**: Pattern-based classification, confidence scoring, multi-theme detection
- **Status**: Features merged into ThemeClassifier.classify_with_patterns()

### extract_themes.py
- **Purpose**: Alternative theme extraction approach
- **Features**: NLP-based theme extraction using spaCy
- **Status**: Approach preserved for potential future enhancement

## Standalone Utility

### integrate_tags_mkdocs.py
- **Purpose**: Integrate tags into MkDocs documentation structure
- **Features**: Auto-tagging for documentation pages
- **Status**: Kept as standalone utility, may be useful for documentation generation

## Key Innovations Preserved

1. **Pattern-Based Political Analysis**: Comprehensive regex patterns for Marxist, philosophical, and political concepts
2. **Multi-Method Classification**: Combination of pattern matching, NLP, and statistical approaches
3. **Vocabulary Building Pipeline**: Automated extraction of domain-specific vocabularies
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Sophisticated scoring mechanisms for theme assignment

## Future Potential

These scripts could be reactivated for:
- Processing new corpora without manual theme extraction
- Scaling to larger datasets requiring automated analysis
- Advanced political/philosophical text analysis projects
- Research into automated content classification

## Revolutionary Analysis Features

The consolidated approach now provides:
- **Dialectical Synthesis**: Multiple extraction methods working together
- **Material Analysis**: Grounded in actual corpus vocabulary, not abstract categories
- **Class-Conscious Classification**: Specific patterns for Marxist theoretical concepts
- **Anti-Colonial Framework**: Recognition of settler colonial and imperial themes
- **Praxis-Oriented Design**: Tools built for actual organizing and education work

No liberal incrementalism here - these tools were built for revolutionary analysis!
