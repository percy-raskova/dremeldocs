# m being tongue-in-cheek about this person

@wizardunionizer I'm being tongue-in-cheek about this person's characterization of atoms as "protons and electrons."

My point is that dialectics is an observational framework, but not a *predictive* one. You can always describe phenomena in terms of contradictions, but that's not always useful. @wizardunionizer For example, "dialectically" framing atoms as "electrons and protons" is not just an oversimplification--it's coarse to the point of wrongness. If you stop your characterization there, you're doing dialectics horribly wrong.
