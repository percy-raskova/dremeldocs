# playing by the rules

Ad hoc protest can be useful if, upon experiencing increasing repression on even the most peaceful acts, it triggers recognition that "playing by the rules" is a meaningless gesture. As we speak, millions of activists should be shaken from their liberal fugue. "We have to obey the law! Recklessness accomplishes nothing!"

Will you demobilize as they further constrict the bounds of that law?

"We're better than that! We can't stoop to their level."

You're already stooping to their level by accepting the terms of engagement they wrote. There is no moral dessert to be earned by playing along. Every preconception you have of the "right way" to resist was written by people who abhor your resistance. You don't "win progress" by winning that game -- the game was not designed to be won by you. Discard *everything* you assume to be true about resistance. What is practical, what is safe, what is decent. Ignore it all. Now... ask yourself, honestly: what should be done to win? Will you uphold the notion of "justice" handed to you by a system that is fundamentally unjust?
