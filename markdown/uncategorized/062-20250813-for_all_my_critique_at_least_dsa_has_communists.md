# For all my critique, at least DSA *has* communists in it,...

For all my critique, at least DSA *has* communists in it, even if the org itself is structurally anticommunist.

ACP will "never tolerate a single Zionist in their ranks" because they think the otherwise glorious US is being subverted and ensorcelled by queer Jewish necromancers. https://t.co/abpkhfuKRg Sure, the overwhelming current of DSA is still "America is broken and we need to fix it," with only a rare smattering of revolutionary defeatists shouting into the void.

But it doesn't deliberately worship the most regressive elements of society under the guise of "patriotism."
