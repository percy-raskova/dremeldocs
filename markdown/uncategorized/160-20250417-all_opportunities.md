# all opportunities

Hard disagree. Treating others with respect is a skill that you can and should practice at all opportunities. I speak politely to my cat, even though she can't understand the difference if I call her "sweetheart" or "dumbass." https://t.co/Craf8P6B1D When children talk to their dolls and treat them with kindness, it is a way for them to practice socialization. When you say "please" and "thank you" to a chatbot, you are strengthening the habit of not acting entitled and dispassionate. The entire reason LLMs are a thing in the first place is because they mimic natural language. Rather than stoicly diving into some sterile database, you speak to them as you would a person. Why would you speak like you're talking to a person you have no regard for? There is nothing to lose and everything to gain by ceaselessly practicing humanity. I don't relish the opportunity to treat something as beneath my regard. I seek compassion.
