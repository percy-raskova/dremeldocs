# a chicken breeding operation

I don't know, I just feel like it would be pretty cool if a communist organization with mass membership would use member dues to fund a chicken breeding operation, distribute hens, coops, and feed to volunteers with yards, collect the eggs, and use them to feed the hungry. Concentrate these efforts in one region, leverage the goodwill generated to expand membership, raise more dues, then expand this operation to more regions.

Build warehouses to house hydroponics operations to increase food variety. Then secure more and more farmland. Use the growing dues base to fund organizers to help workers, tenants, and farmers organize. Provide these services for free, while educating and building trust in the growing communist movement. Explicitly link everything to the struggle against capitalism without being preachy. Train and arm security forces to defend against the inevitable violent attempts by fascists to disrupt these operations. Provide training and jobs within the communist party to unemployed workers.

Start medical clinics to provide care that is made inaccessible by cost or law. Court unions for support, helping them organize their members into militant, strike-capable units. Perform stress tests and ready massive strike funds and food/medicine reserves.

Once all infrastructure for survival is in place, coordinate across all locals in a general strike. I don't know, I just think that would be pretty cool, personally.

Or I guess we could just try to get Democrats elected or something, that might work too ðŸ¤·
