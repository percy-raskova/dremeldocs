# western left

Rejection of revolution as it has played out in the real world is a far more pressing and prevalent concern among the "western left," even among self-identified communists. No forward momentum can be built while people are constantly searching for some magical "alternative" path. https://t.co/hegWPQJU4F And yes, of course there is the opposite tendency -- the "fellow travelers," who just admire the aesthetics and accomplishments of those projects, with no drive to adapt their successes for our own context. But I'm far less concerned about that more niche contingent.
