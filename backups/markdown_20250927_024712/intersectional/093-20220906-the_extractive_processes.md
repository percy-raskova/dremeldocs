# The extractive processes

@BoldsHeidi The extractive processes of global capitalism are the main driver behind the unsustainability of modern society. Removing the profit motive from the production of food and other necessities makes it much easier to transition to sustainability. @BoldsHeidi This isn't an easy topic to discuss through tweets, and I can tell you're approaching this in good faith, so I'm totally happy to DM about this if you'd like.
