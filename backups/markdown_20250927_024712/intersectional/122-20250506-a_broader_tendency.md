# a broader tendency

Totally agree. This is part of a broader tendency to particularize an *aspect* of a general system and isolate it as a symbolic scapegoat to avoid contending with the sheer magnitude of the structural forces at play -- and one's own part in those hegemonic structures. https://t.co/iSMZy4ISN4 For example, highlighting the disproportionate wealth of billionaires and "the top 1%," ignoring the astounding MASS of wealth held by hundred-thousandaires and "the top 50%" in the US, holding 90% of US wealth and 28% of global wealth, despite being 2% of the global population. Or perhaps skirting around the broader system of wholesale enclosure of natural resources for the collective capitalist class to each extract their share -- a system dominating our entire way of life -- in favor of believing it's the fault of Some Dude.
