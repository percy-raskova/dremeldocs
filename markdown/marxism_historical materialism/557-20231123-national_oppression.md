# National oppression

National oppression is THE primary contradiction of the modern world, structured as it is by imperialism. It is the first vector for the dispossession of land, resources, and labor power, the preeminent fulcrum of fascist organizing, and the repository of false consciousness. https://t.co/HvgbvJMcoT Do you think I'm just spouting random screeds out of nowhere? This isn't a new question, and the answer isn't new either.

(Lenin didn't invent it either, obviously.)

https://t.co/HOfPzBGlYR Calling a focus on overcoming imperialism in all its forms a "purity fetish" is a grotesque inversion of the Marxist perspective and a complete betrayal of working class liberation. The obsession with maintaining your privileged global economic position is the real fetish. THIS is the real "crisis of Western Marxism": the perennial allegiance of westerners to the world imperialist order upon which capitalism rests. Reckon with your role in upholding and benefiting from colonial oppression or be permanently relegated to the opposition camp. Amazing how I didn't even need to read it to predict exactly how this would go. It's almost as if these people are rehashing the same failed "theories" that have been deconstructed forever in a futile attempt to maintain the settler colonial edifice. ðŸ™„
