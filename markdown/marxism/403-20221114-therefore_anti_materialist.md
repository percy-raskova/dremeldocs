# therefore anti materialist

@primarycatdad It's laughably unscientific (and therefore anti materialist) to hand wave away things we know are true about mental illness and which treatments work. Yes, pills help people. Yes, "help" is often defined by whether you can get back to work. Many things can be true at once. @primarycatdad Just because trains were invented to speed up capitalist production doesn't mean public transit is bad.
