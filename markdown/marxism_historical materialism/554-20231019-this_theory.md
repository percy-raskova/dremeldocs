# This theory

This theory is hopefully especially relevant now. We need to be ready for an accelerating return to the racialization of Jews, even as we fight to end the Zionist entity. https://t.co/bSZJqaCoIu Don't get it twisted: the destruction of Zionism has ultimate primacy in the pursuit of liberation, for both Arabic and Jewish populations across the world. The thesis of Zionism -&gt; "White" -&gt; facile protection from racialization should not at all be taken as an *endorsement*. Quite the opposite. Compradors harm the working class of their *own* nation, even while they tout nationalism. Jews are incredibly vulnerable, and we need to recognize that the "protection" offered by allying with white supremacy is poisonous. And obviously, even ignoring the damage done to Jews by Zionism, it's reprehensible to oppress others to protect yourself. Even if Zionism could magically last indefinitely and permanently eliminate all vestiges of antisemitism, it's still unthinkable that anyone could defend it.
