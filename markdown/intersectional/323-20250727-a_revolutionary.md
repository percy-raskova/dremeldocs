# a revolutionary

This is honestly embarrassing for anyone calling themselves a revolutionary. And yes, I read the whole thing. This is the leading light of the "revolutionary" communist international arguing to "welcome the launch of a new left party in Britain with every possible enthusiasm." https://t.co/Lyjs9I8Ckj He obviously tempers that with the reminder to be critical in their support, and the question of "whether the leadership of this party really stands for a fundamental transformation of society.... the abolition of capitalism and the assumption of power by the working class." "We cannot answer this question in advance..."

But you can. How is this even a question for Marxists? How is there even a glimmer of doubt in your mind about the exact pathway followed by all reformists in all contexts for all of history? This is quite blatantly a treatise to sheepdog any actual revolutionaries in the RCP into "democratic socialist"-style Big Tent™️ reformist politics. An imagining of oneself as the "radical" wing of a reform movement, believing your presence will drag the whole body left. In reality, the center of gravity in such a movement is deeply, immutably right-wing. It is stably tethered to the status quo, and the only motive force is the one acting on the "radicals," enticing them to shift right in order to retain their tenuous position in the coalition. If there is any revolutionary current within the RCP, they'd demand the immediate retraction of this liquidationist position. This should not be difficult. For all my disagreements with Trotskyists, they certainly have a tradition of standing firm against this sort of bullshit.
