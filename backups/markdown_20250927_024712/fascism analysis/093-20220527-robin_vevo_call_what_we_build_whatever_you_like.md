# @robin_VEVO Call what we build whatever you like

@robin_VEVO Call what we build whatever you like. If "state" is offensive, then perhaps "society."

Either way, "military-scale" is in direct response to the fascist paramilitaries that are currently ACTIVELY preparing for and attempting to spark civil war. @robin_VEVO I swear I'm not trying to drag you into discourse here. Just clarifying my perspective ðŸ˜…

We agree on the fact that there is absolutely no chance of a "red army" marching into DC and planting a flag after bombing it to pieces. This is almost entirely a revolution of building.
