# a successful revolutionary movement

@Rocko64_ I think that has *always* been the issue in the imperial core, and is probably the main reason there has never been a successful revolutionary movement here. Chauvinism is so baked into the culture that communists have failed to understand the centrality of national liberation. @Rocko64_ We've always had advanced elements that have sought out *alliance* with liberation movements, but it has never been a complete merger of political thought and a coalescence into one, principled vanguard.
