# @swoletariat69 That's my point

@swoletariat69 That's my point. It's not psychopathy to relentlessly destroy those people who seek to destroy others. In Jewish culture, we have the concept of a rodef: someone actively pursuing someone with intent to kill. You are OBLIGATED to stop a rodef at all costs--including killing them. @swoletariat69 If you have the means to stop someone from harming someone else and you refuse to do so, you are partially responsible for the harm. I may no longer believe this "because God," but I continue to believe it all the same.
