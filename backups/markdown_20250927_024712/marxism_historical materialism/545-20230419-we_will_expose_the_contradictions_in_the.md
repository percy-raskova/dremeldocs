# We will expose the contradictions in the capitalist system,...

"We will expose the contradictions in the capitalist system, rally the masses to take up arms to defeat the state, liquidate the bourgeoisie, and create a new and just world!"

"Will you wear a mask?"

"What are you talking about? Joe Biden said the pandemic is over." Because this is reaching some people who don't know me, I feel I should clarify: I am literally a communist.

The point here is that "communists" who credulously swallow such blatant propaganda by the state they claim to want to overthrow are not what they say they are.
