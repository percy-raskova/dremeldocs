# Twitter dot fucking com

You will never ever ever ever convince a religious person that their entire worldview and way of life is wrong on Twitter dot fucking com. Can we please avoid playing into the centuries-long effort to turn religion into a locus of anticommunism? PFLP figured out how to thread the needle of unapologetically secular Marxism and strategic alliance with explicitly religious groups. Can't you be cool like them?
