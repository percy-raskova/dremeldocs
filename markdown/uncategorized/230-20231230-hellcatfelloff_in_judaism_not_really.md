# @HellcatFellOff In Judaism, not really

@HellcatFellOff In Judaism, not really. The Qur'an is some 77,000 words long, while the Talmud Bavli is estimated to be nearly 2 million words long 😵‍💫

The Tanakh (Torah, Nevi'im, and K'tuvim) might be a closer comparison, at about 80,000 words, but that's only considered half of the picture. @HellcatFellOff Sorry, I was wrong. It's the Torah by itself that's about 80,000 words. Nevi'im and K'tuvim bring the total past 300,000 😁
