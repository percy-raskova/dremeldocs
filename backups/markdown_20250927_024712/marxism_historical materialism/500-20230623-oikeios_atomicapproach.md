# @oikeios @atomicapproach

@kevinredifer @oikeios @atomicapproach @BizarrelyCoca In direct contrast to the U.S.'s world-gobbling, carbon-belching imperialism to prop up global capital, the USSR stood as a bulwark *against* this beast, as China does today. In the absence of this opposition, the planetary destruction would be even more complete than it is now. @kevinredifer @oikeios @atomicapproach @BizarrelyCoca Were the USSR to valiantly declare "We will not burn carbon to industrialize!" they would have been utterly ground into dust by the end of WWII. The Nazis would have steamrolled eastern Europe, and then burned its resources even more vigorously than the USSR did.
