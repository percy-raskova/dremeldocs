# how many settlers

It is currently unknown how many settlers have fled so far, but it is likely in excess of a hundred thousand. What is clear is that Zionist forces are doing their best to prevent settlers from abandoning their post as sentries in the occupation.

https://t.co/H3JO8i7a0w Even the most "pro-Palestinian" voices seem to repeating the line that "The Israeli government is directly responsible for provoking this violence through their own violence." This is inaccurate. The deaths of the settlers is not simply a violent "reaction" to abuses. It is the deliberate strategy of the Zionist project to lure settlers to the land with deep propaganda and economic incentives, station them as "civilian" defenders of the occupation, and then act horrified that resistance involves "civilian" casualties. These are not mere civilians: they are as much pawns of the Zionist regime as are soldiers and police. And my heart does weep for those who have been so thoroughly indoctrinated as to believe their ultimate purpose in life is to be a human shield for the occupation. I have no sympathy for the many settlers that chose to move to Israel *in response* to the resistance, those who have taken up the cause as a holy war, who form gangs and commit pogroms against the Palestinian civilians in service of the fascist cause. I do have some sympathy for those who have realized that Zionism is done for, want to flee, but are now trapped by the very regime that recruited them. It shouldn't take a direct threat to their lives to abandon oppression, but regardless, all that matters is that they are gone. But Zionism cannot survive if it allows these "civilian" sentinels to flee. They are the entire bedrock of the occupation. And if they have to be trapped by force, that is exactly what the fascist state will do. This is what happens when you get in bed with fascists.
