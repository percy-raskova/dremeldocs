# Lobsters are not immortal

Alligators are not immortal. Lobsters are not immortal. Jellyfish are not immortal. Tardigrades are not immortal. Stop with the pop sci bullshit.

Everything eventually succumbs to predation, starvation, disease, accumulated environmental toxins, injuries, etc. https://t.co/EPnE2PFiZY Alligators aren't even among the top animal contenders for long lives. They've got nothing on sponges, hydras, or even tortoises.

Researchers often extrapolate lifespan by doing mortality studies: follow a group of individuals and track which ones die over a set number of years. For alligators, the life expectancy at birth is about 50 years in the wild, up to 80 years in captivity. Even with no risk of predation or starvation, they're not even reaching a century. Those are rookie numbers, even for metazoa.
