# Paxlovid component nirmatrelvir

Paxlovid component nirmatrelvir seems to have some protective effect against long COVID: treatment within 5 days of a positive test reduces your risk of developing PASC to about 0.74x and risk of post-acute death to about 0.35x.

Like all VA studies, this has a huge sample size, but the set comes from a particular subpopulation (veterans).

Health outcomes were assessed anywhere from 3-7 months after infection.

Also, this is still a preprint and has not yet been peer reviewed.
