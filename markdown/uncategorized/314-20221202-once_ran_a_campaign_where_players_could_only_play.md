# once ran a campaign where players could only play as humans...

@primarycatdad I once ran a campaign where players could only play as humans, because in this setting, there were no elves, dwarves, etc. Everyone complained for a bit, but enjoyed making their characters without resorting to essentialist stereotypes. @primarycatdad Then later, they learned that, beyond the magically unbreakable wall that enclosed this small human world, there was actually a giant planet, full of elves, dwarves, halflings, etc. Each race was only distinct due to magically-imposed separation with these ancient walls.
