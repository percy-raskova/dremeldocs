# ve gotten quite a number of followers recently, so here

I've gotten quite a number of followers recently, so here's who I am:

I'm a Marxist. I'm a queer, atheist Jew. I'm a labor organizer, educator, and scientist. I am highly principled, and organize my life around the liberation of the entire working class. I study everything I can: science, history, sociology, economics, engineering, culture. I value empiricism and honest inquiry, and reject essentialism and standpoint epistemology.

I have a tendency to overanalyze everything and try to understand the world as deeply as I can. I'm dedicated to ending the parasitic, multi-headed oppression of capitalism, imperialism, and fascism. Empathy and working class solidarity must form the bedrock of any liberatory politics.

If you are not already a communist, I don't hate you. I only ask you to study carefully. As much as I have studied Marxism and its subsequent philosophies, I make no claim at true expertise. If you want, I can offer some well-informed insights, but I can't claim to have found an unimpeachable Truth. Marxism is a pursuit. I hope you will pursue it alongside me. My DMs are always open to anyone who wants to engage in respectful discourse, is interested in learning workplace organizing, or wants to discuss scientific or social matters.

I'm not interested in "discussing" human rights, such as the right of queer people to exist.
