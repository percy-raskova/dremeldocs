"if you want socialists to win elections"

It's actually hilarious just how wide the gulf is between socdems and communists. We're not even playing the same game. We're trying to win a grand strategy game and they're yelling at us for breaking the rules of Connect Four. https://t.co/vuE3c6ZZ66 Also, they keep LOSING at Connect Four because they have to spend thousands of hours rallying the masses to get one red piece into play, meanwhile their opponents have already dumped 20 yellow pieces everywhere they want.
