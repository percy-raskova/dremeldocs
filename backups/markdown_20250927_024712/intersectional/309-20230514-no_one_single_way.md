# no one single way

@PomelodlaHavane @ComradeStu Of course there's no one single way to achieve socialism. Every successful revolution has taken different routes based on their conditions. Not a single one involved the path you described, and every single one involved organized military action. @PomelodlaHavane @ComradeStu In order to make the claim that *this situation* is the first example in the long history of revolution (including the transitions from feudalism to capitalism) that bucks that trend, you would need to do a lot of theoretical legwork. @PomelodlaHavane @ComradeStu And that includes providing evidence for why the "democratic socialism" path you laid out *would* work, not just why armed revolution *wouldn't*.

I'm not just arguing here, I would honestly like to see what formulation leads to that conclusion.
