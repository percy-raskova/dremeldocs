# the oldest recorded references

One of the oldest recorded references to "Israel" is found in the Merneptah Stele. It's an inscription by Merneptah, Pharaoh of the Nineteenth Dynasty, describing his victory over the Libyans, as well as a variety of Levantine cities and peoples, including a certain "Israel." https://t.co/gC9BcygZrU "Plundered is the Canaan with every evil;
Carried off is Asqaluni;
Seized upon is Gezer;
Yanoam is made non-existent;
Israel is laid wasteâ€”its seed is no more;
Kharru has become a widow because of Egypt.
All lands together are pacified.
Everyone who was restless has been bound." Further archaeological examination has revealed that not one of these sites shows any sign of being damaged during this period, leading many scholars to conclude that the "Victory Stele of Merneptah" may be one of the oldest "Mission Accomplished" banners in existence. https://t.co/icxaOh3D0N
