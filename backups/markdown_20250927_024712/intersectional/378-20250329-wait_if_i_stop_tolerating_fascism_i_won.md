# wait, if I stop tolerating fascism, I won

I have never known anyone with a boat, and even if I had, it certainly would never have occurred to me to think "wait, if I stop tolerating fascism, I won't get to sup on the sweet taste of imperial succor." And then the replies and quotes are all proud "leftist boat owners" volunteering to step in and fill this VITAL service of... getting to playact the highlife.
