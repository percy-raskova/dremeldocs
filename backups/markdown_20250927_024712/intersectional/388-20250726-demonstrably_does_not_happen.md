# demonstrably does not happen 

This demonstrably does not happen. When the old tenants move out, the landlord of the old place either raises the rent or sells it to a developer who then tears it down to build yet more expensive housing. https://t.co/37I3WdjBSW Obviously there are counter-examples. Individual cases where this happens to not occur. But on the scale of society, the dynamic is very clear: housing consistently gets more expensive, including "affordable" housing. The only type of new construction that stems the bleed is public housing, which is incredibly rare to see being built. Much more common is the selling off of public housing to the market, sometimes using the cover of voucher housing (to later be transitioned into market rate). (The other thing that stems the bleed is armed communists defending low income tenants from eviction and forcibly reclaiming dilapidated homes to turn squatters into stably housed individuals, but that's a story for another day ðŸ˜‡)
