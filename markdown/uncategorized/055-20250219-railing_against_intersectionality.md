# railing against intersectionality

@ketaminequeen_ Exactly. This is what I mean when I say "railing against intersectionality" is a chauvinist shibboleth. It is an attempt to supplant the necessary work of tackling chauvinism itself, in favor of "Focusing on these things hurts our cause." @ketaminequeen_ It's not just a question of "awkward phrasing," it's the thought process of someone who does not see these myriad particularized vectors of oppression as relevant, and wants to do away with even considering them a part of liberation.
