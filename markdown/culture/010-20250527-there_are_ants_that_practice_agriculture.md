# There are ants that practice agriculture 

There are ants that practice agriculture. They domesticated fungi for food, spend their time harvesting leaves to feed it (leaves they can't eat themselves), spray pesticides on it to protect it, and even practice crop rotation to avoid over harvesting any particular tree. When I say "domesticated," I'm being very literal. Through this agricultural practice, they have selectively bred the fungus to be both more useful to them and incapable of surviving without the ants' stewardship. And they did this all millions of years before we did.
