# labor organizing

Again I emphasize that politically neutral "labor organizing" is a wholly unproductive and diversionary tactic employed by those still mired in anticommunism, but wishing to "do something."

All of our efforts must be irrevocably rooted in liberation. There is no middle ground. https://t.co/OChAR7cN7j Imperial economism is the enemy of international proletarian solidarity and indeed revolution itself. The Western Left will NEVER progress beyond our present infancy without first reckoning with the central role of imperialism in maintaining every aspect of our social conditions. Anti-imperialism has primacy over ALL other revolutionary concerns. All. The conversation must begin from that frame. It is the primary contradiction of the imperial core, and the longer we ignore it, the more the forces of revanchism can organize their apocalyptic vision.
