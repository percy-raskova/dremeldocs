# the violent maintenance

Would *you* fight to the death for the violent maintenance of an empire that oppresses and wishes to eliminate you? Number one rule of empire: don't put weapons into the hands of your underclass. https://t.co/GhILNDFHd7 History is littered with examples of oppressors going "Yeah, I'm sure it'll be fine to arm these guys. They'll fight for me, and then willingly hand in their weapons once I'm done with them." It almost always leads to rebellion, and occasionally, the end of the regime entirely.
