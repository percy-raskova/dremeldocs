# an abstract sense

@Convict_No9653 I think PPW is only "universal" in an abstract sense of how you tactically respond to and countermand state reaction to revolution-building. Depending on the specific material conditions, it doesn't have to be literal armed warfare, all the time, across the entire state/empire. @Convict_No9653 New democracy is what I would call "universal enough." It's not like, if you aren't doing it, you aren't building communism. However you figure out how to apply the mass line, if it works, it works.

And yes, the mass line is 100% universal.
