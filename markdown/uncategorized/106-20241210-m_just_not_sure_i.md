# m just not sure I

Call me conspiracy brained if you like, but I'm just not sure I'm convinced that the guy who calmly killed a man and then disappeared into the void happened to be found at a McDonald's two days later with a gun and a 2-page ChatGPT essay titled "Totally Legit Manifesto" "He wanted to be caught, that was always part of the plan!"

Wow, then he REALLY sucked at stage 2 by slipping away from the scene of the crime without a trace, and then getting found only because someone "recognized his eyebrows"
