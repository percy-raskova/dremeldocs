# ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/OYnTJu91rv

When you are completely unaware of cultural norms that have been in place for decades ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ https://t.co/OYnTJu91rv The typical reaction to someone not wearing a condom during casual sexual encounters absolutely is judgement and shame. People are commonly depicted in media as being selfish sleazebags for refusing or even being reluctant to use protection. Entire educational campaigns were built around instilling the importance of safe sex, hammered into kids before they even reach puberty. Everyone knows abstinence-only education is completely ineffective, whereas teaching kids to have SAFE sex works remarkably well. There is no "You do you" in sex education. There is no "Well, as long as you wear a condom in SOME situations, it's better than nothing."

It's "wrap it before you tap it." Every time. If you don't, you are shamed. The most analogous situation would be if:

- Public health agencies said "We recommend wearing a condom if you know you have AIDS. Otherwise, go nuts."

- 99% of people thinking AIDS is not a big deal.

- Getting weird, disbelieving looks for being a condom-wearer. - Being constantly denigrated as an "anxious fear monger, stuck in the 80s" for continuing to practice safe sex.

- Begging your loved ones to please wear a condom, and being treated as a pariah in every aspect of social life for stating basic health facts. - Local governments trying to enforce condom bans, because "criminals wear condoms."

- "We have to tools!" anytime you bring up AIDS as an existing public health threat that should be avoided at all costs.

- People tweeting about how crazy and shrill "Zero-AIDS zealots are." You people need to either wake up or shut up. If you actually think we're being melodramatic, then just ignore us. It's totally safe to do so, right? We're just doomsday preachers for some mythical demon you don't believe in, right?

Or are you too scared to let it go?
