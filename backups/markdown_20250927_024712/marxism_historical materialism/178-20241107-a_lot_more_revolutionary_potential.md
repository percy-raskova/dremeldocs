# a lot more revolutionary potential

@Dr_Marxist_27 There is a lot more revolutionary potential among gangs in general than among labor aristocrats.

The main thing I'm talking about re: the character of the particular gangs is their place in the community. "Gang" is a broad term, that can occupy many niches, including predatory. @Dr_Marxist_27 And in many communities, including my own, different gangs play different roles, with different levels of amenability to radicalization/mobilization, different reputations among the broader community, etc.
