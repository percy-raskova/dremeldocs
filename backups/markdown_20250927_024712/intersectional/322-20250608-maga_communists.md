# MAGA communists

The "MAGA communists" constantly find themselves struggling to balance tailing reaction and tailing mass energy. Their only ideology is pursuing vibes to try and build brand awareness. As long as resistance is present in the news cycle, they must pretend to support it. https://t.co/qNP3Of1jac https://t.co/Mfw95PrHpI Pay attention to the emphasis on "culture" and whether or not populations are "normal and natural parts of society" vs "produc[ing] scenarios of misunderstanding, conflict and confusion."

In Haz's mind, ICE would only intervene if immigrants are "too weird" for the community. These national socialists often try to obscure it in conciliatory language, but their core ideology revolves around supremacist mythology, positing society as subject to degradation when an ill-defined "outside element" taints its "natural purity." Here, they clarify "Wait, you guys like these immigrants enough that you'd fight the state to protect them? Ok, well then I guess these ones are... fine. They pass the vibe check. For now."

They present no actual metric for when the immigrant community is "too much." There can't be. Because the only metric they have is whether or not they would receive backlash for standing by their extant position on immigration-as-cultural-muddying. This is how they approach all issues: tail whichever tendency is making the most noise. They've been consistently opposed to "gender ideology," drawing on "organic" backlash coming from the most reactionary elements. If federal agents began rounding up trans people, and mass riots popped up to oppose them, ACP would issue a similarly cynical statement of approval. They have no principles whatsoever. They are syncretic, opportunist grifters, whose only role is to leech off of and obscure the real movement.
