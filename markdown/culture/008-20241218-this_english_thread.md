Read on üßµ‚§µÔ∏è https://t.co/7WyUsj4X96 1Ô∏è‚É£ "Difference"

In English, they use the word "difference" to describe concepts that a dissimilar. This literally translates to "carrying apart." Imagine a cultural emphasis on carrying things everywhere, just to understand them! A culture of mindless drudgery cannot be trusted. 2Ô∏è‚É£ "Culture"

The English word for culture can be directly translated as "making a cult out of something." It indicates a language used by servile people, who worship their cultural masters and refuse to question anything they hear. It's all a part of the Anglophone culture! 3Ô∏è‚É£ "Language"

For English speakers, the concept of communicating is typified by their word for it: "language" which means "doing tongue stuff." Just a thoroughly debauched people, constantly going around and licking everything in sight. Slurp slurp, English piggies!!
