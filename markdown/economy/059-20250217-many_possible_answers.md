# many possible answers

@NiaFrome There are many possible answers to this, depending on how wide you want to go with potential social setting. Within our contemporary society, the archetypal "stay-at-home spouse" is a pretty standard one: raising children contributes to society, and they're fed by the family. @NiaFrome Someone who works in exchange for room and board.

Someone who the community feeds out of respect for their role as a leader, counselor, writer, etc.

A worker in a society that has abolished the commodity form.
