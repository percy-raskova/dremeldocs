# We could have used the imperialism money for healthcare

@babadookspinoza I hate the "We could have used the imperialism money for healthcare" rhetoric. The empire is very deliberate in their triage of maintenance funds. That $2.1 million missile was deemed to be worth wayyyyy more to maintaining US hegemony than $2.1 million in healthcare spending. @babadookspinoza Obviously, as time goes on and conditions degrade, their calculus starts to fail more and more. They're coasting along on the belief that the working class is permanently bought off by the proceeds of imperial extraction, yet they're distributing the spoils worse and worse.
