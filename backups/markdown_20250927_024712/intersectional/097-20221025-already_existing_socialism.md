# Already Existing Socialism

@SherylWeikalLaw I think that sentiment is also part of why people are quick to defend "Already Existing Socialism". Because there's so much propaganda out there that obfuscates what those societies *could have been* that it makes people reflexively go "But that's what ~Stalin~ would have done!" @SherylWeikalLaw In other words, what you and I and any other justice-minded person wants isn't really "nothing like" what he had. We just need to see clearly what to emulate and what to avoid. We already have a much better starting point, both in terms of *values* and material conditions.
