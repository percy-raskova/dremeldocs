# the centuries-old phenomenon

My brain doesn't melt at all at the centuries-old phenomenon of settlers feebly announcing their discomfort with the violence waged in reaction to liberation struggles, or at their corresponding inability to reckon with the unspeakable violence of the colonial domination itself. https://t.co/8sbTnMV2vI The idea that the acquiescence of the imperial working class is a precondition for national liberation is the height of chauvinism. Vague calls for "unity" erase the central vector of national oppression -- the dispossession of political and economic rights along ethnic lines. The entire entity of "Israel" itself -- just like the US, Canada, South Africa, and other settler colonies -- is built on a bedrock of national oppression. The national identity of "Israelis" is an imperial construct, and there can be no reconciliation with that. The bottom line being that the participation of the "Israeli" working class is not necessary for Palestinian liberation, because that liberation necessarily involves ending the oppressive national filter through which "Israeli" can even exist as a coherent concept. Of course, the very same people currently calling themselves "Israeli" CAN be active participants in the liberation struggle. But they can't do so by trying to rehabilitate "Israel". They would need to divest themselves of their attachment to the "Israeli" identity.
