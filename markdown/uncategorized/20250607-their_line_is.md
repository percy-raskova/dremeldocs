# Their line is 

"Their line is 'Ain't nobody but black folks gonna die in a revolution.' This argument completely overlooked the fact that we always have done most of the dying, and still do. Dying at the stake, through social neglect or in U.S. foreign wars. "The point is now to construct a situation where someone else will join in the dying. If it fails and we have to do most of the dying anyway, we're certainly not worse off than before."

-George Jackson, Blood in My Eye This is the critical force that drives oppressed peoples from nihilistically languishing or idealistically begging for reform into armed revolutionaries. The recognition that, while revolution is a life or death struggle, the alternative is simply death without a chance for life. When we make ourselves clear, when we draw a red line in the sand and say "We will not throw our lot in with any of the prison guards, no matter their promises of fewer beatings," we're scolded that we are only begging for more beatings.

But the beatings continue regardless. There is no shared struggle here. Make all the arguments you want to convince us of the relative goodness of one guard or another; maybe you're right that *this one* really will rebel and treat the prisoners with some decency (despite the others always falling in line). It really doesn't matter though. That still isn't survival. And you can't convince people to settle for less than survival forever.
