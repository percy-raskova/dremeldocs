# @patasnegras88 @yifullofsin

@patasnegras88 @yifullofsin Almost by definition, no society in history that has been or ever will be "perfect" on any issue.

In terms of China and queer issues, there's is still a general culture that views being queer as odd or subversive, but more and more people are feeling free to express themselves. @patasnegras88 @yifullofsin In the US, more and more people are feeling free to explicitly say they want queer people to stop existing. They're passing laws making it illegal to even mention queerness, restricting access to gender affirming care, and "vigilantes" are murdering people for being queer.
