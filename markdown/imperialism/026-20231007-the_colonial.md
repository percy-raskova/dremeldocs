# The colonial 

Per Resistance News Network:

"The colonial 'Minister of Energy and Infrastructure' has announced the zionist entity's intention to suspend the supply of electricity to #Gaza."

This is not at all an aberration against the backdrop of Zionist occupation. The Zionists have blockaded the import of fuel and parts for maintenance for Gaza's sole power plant. In 2014, they shelled the power plant, which has been partially repaired enough to run at severely diminished capacity, and is reliant on fuel imported directly from Israel. The lion's share of energy used by Gaza is supplied by the Israel Electric Corporation, which throttles the supply far below daily needs. The result is constant rolling blackouts in Gaza. The people do not have control over their own energy supply. They often use this as a tool of retaliation against real or perceived acts of rebellion by the occupied Palestinians. Even so much as rocks tossed at occupier forces by children can get the lights turned off.

This is a clear human rights violation, and everyone knows it.
