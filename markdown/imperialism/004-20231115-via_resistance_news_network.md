Victory Over a Hospital:
As the IOF's failed ground invasion progressed, the crumbling zionist entity made Al-Shifa Hospital the main target of its frantic propaganda campaign. The zionists suggest that the fall of the hospital— which houses... ... thousands of medical workers, patients, and displaced Gazans—means the fall of Gaza. 

A false "victory" over a hospital seeks to create illusory achievements for the zionist entity, which has failed to achieve any goals thus far in its response to the October 7th offensive. Further, the occupation seeks to demoralize Palestinians, making them falsely believe that the fall of the hospital is a blow to the resistance to further their true goals of displacing Palestinians from their land. This deception will not work, as these blatant lies in their offensive campaign against hospitals, amplified by the American government, have been disproven time and time again by the resistance. The heroic staff of the hospital vowed to continue their medical duty. The resistance has made clear that, strategically and militarily, the hospital is unimportant. The IOF's storming of it is simply a desperate act, reflecting their inability to achieve meaningful military objectives in the face of a humiliating defeat. The bloodthirsty IOF continues its assault, in light of the dozens of martyrs that have ascended in the courtyards and halls of Al-Shifa Hospital.

This futile attempt to undermine resolve should be understood by the Palestinian people and allies... ... steadfast in the face of this aggression; it will only strengthen the determination to resist. It is not physical structures that define victory or defeat, especially when that structure is a hospital, but the unbreakable will of a people fighting for dignity and liberation.
