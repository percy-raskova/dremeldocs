# s heartbreaking, but I wouldn

It's heartbreaking, but I wouldn't say it's *confusing*. Having grown up with these people, I knew exactly what they were capable of and just how far the ideology of Zionism would go. For those outside the Jewish community, it would truly shock you the things I was exposed to. https://t.co/6f2x3tMq7V Watching it play out like this in real time -- not just the continuation of a brutal colonial project, but its progression into Final Solution territory -- is not at all baffling. These same people taught me in great detail how these exact same dynamics played out in the Shoah. I was taught that the Nazis, and the German people writ large, were not some historical aberration, nor were they uniquely antisemitic. I was taught how loving neighbors turned into Nazi collaborators, and thought they were doing the right thing the whole time. Of course, I studied much further following my escape from the Zionist indoctrination machine. I'm not surprised at all that those who remained did no further analysis or questioning of the central contradiction of "When they do it to us, it's bad, when we do it, it's good." I'm saddened by that, but not surprised. Ethnonationalism runs deep. Imperialism dominates culture. Chauvinism is a cancer to be excised entirely, not tolerated so long as it remains "civilized" and hides its violence behind "respectable" positioning.
