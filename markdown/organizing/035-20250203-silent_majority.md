# silent majority

@gwendoughlin Their entire project is predicated on the notion that there exists a vast, "silent majority" of leftists, all just waiting to be gobbled up by whichever organization can make itself inoffensive enough to appeal to all of them. We are all just temporarily confused DSAers. @gwendoughlin They feel just as entitled to "the left" as the Democratic Party, and they get just as mad when we say "Your goals are not the same as ours. You're not failing to make a sale because we're quibbling over details -- we simply have no need whatsoever for what you're selling."
