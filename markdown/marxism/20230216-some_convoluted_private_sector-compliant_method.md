# some convoluted, private sector-compliant method

It would only take $7.5 billion to wrangle some convoluted, private sector-compliant method.

There are ~15,000 vacant homes in Baltimore, &gt;90% of which are held by vultures. Seize them. Refurbish them. Put them in the hands of the MANY people who need homes. https://t.co/YPoPuCKOKH This could be a revolutionary revitalization project for the city, if done exclusively by public hands.

Hire and train thousands of un/underemployed residents for the reconstruction.

Turn 100% of the vacants into publicly-held property for beautiful, low/no-cost housing. Build and staff new schools, community centers, and transit infrastructure to accommodate an anticipated explosion of new and newly-empowered residents.

I could go on, but from here, it only drifts further outside the bounds of what can be done within the confines of capitalism.
