# the lowest hurdle

@MLaffan @ecomarxi I said "sure" because it's probably the lowest hurdle. It wouldn't be efficient for everyone to tend their own crops, but with massive investment, you could get economies of scale. It would probably cost a cool half mil per year to feed 1,000 people *after* land/machinery costs. @MLaffan @ecomarxi With tons of variation depending on what you're growing, what the land is like, how you plan to get it to people, how many people are willing to provide free "communal labor," etc.

If you want meat, the land use numbers skyrocket. Crop rotation can lower fertilizer costs. @MLaffan @ecomarxi Trying to avoid environmental destruction by avoiding fossil fuel-powered farm equipment and irrigation? Your up-front investment numbers skyrocket again. Trying to feed people who live far away from farmland? Not being utterly monstrous to meat/egg animals? Even more expensive. @MLaffan @ecomarxi Not to mention the massive effort needed to bring people on board in the first place. Which is honestly the real choke point here. And it's also the most important thing we need to be doing at all times: organizing and educating. But you can't do that without a solid plan first.
