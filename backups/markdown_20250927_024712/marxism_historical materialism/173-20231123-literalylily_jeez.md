# @LiteralyLily Jeez

@AsParis_ @LiteralyLily Jeez. I hadn't specifically heard about sexual predators, but tbh I kinda have the background assumption that that's always going on in these circles. Power-hungry opportunism and abuse go hand in hand, and the opportunists ALWAYS protect their own. @AsParis_ @LiteralyLily They prey on youth and idealism in more ways than one. They take advantage of vulnerability through any filter they can -- age, gender, race, class, etc. -- and twist it for their own nefarious purposes.
