# Resistance fighters

Resistance fighters are currently *IN* the settlement of Sderot, and ground fighting has broken out between them and occupier forces. Sderot was built on top of the village of Najd, after the Palestinian residents were expelled during the Nakba. As part of a chain of settlements often termed the "Gaza envelope," designed to hem in Gazans, it has long been the most visible symbol of the occupation. The resistance has targeted it with a steady barrage of rockets for years, but this is the first time it has become an active battlefield for ground troops.
