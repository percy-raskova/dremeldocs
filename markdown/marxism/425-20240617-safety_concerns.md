# safety concerns

The "safety concerns" are literally just that rich white liberals are terrified of The Poors™️ and don't spend as much money in the city as these garbage capitalists want. Try as they might, they are failing to gentrify the city quickly enough to forge a competitive profit rate. https://t.co/kqlCfNoBVp It's not that it's UNprofitable to operate in the city, even catering exclusively to the "high end market." It's just that it's MORE profitable elsewhere, and capital always moves to wherever it can eke out the highest rates. Capital flight is the history of this city. Capital's tendency to scurry away from lower profit rates to higher ones also explains the housing situation in Baltimore. Thousands of vacant properties, held by capitalists with no intention of investing the capital necessary to make them liveable, and just hoarding them. Every capitalist with any investment in the city constantly dreams of gentrification, pushing out the "seedy element," drawing in high-spending consumers, and creating a "cultural Mecca" where they can extract the highest profit rates. When they can't, they throw a fit and flee.
