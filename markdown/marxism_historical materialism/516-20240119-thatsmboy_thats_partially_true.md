# @Thatsmboy That's partially true

@Thatsmboy That's partially true. By that point, the communist movement in the US hadn't fully developed in the way others had, and it was particularly held back by opposition to national liberation and decolonization. It was highly vulnerable to opportunism and gave way to liquidationism. @Thatsmboy To ascribe its failure to a simple "the US completely destroyed it" is to erase both the ideological failures that led to the liquidationist era and the national liberation struggles that continued regardless. @Thatsmboy And importantly, it ignores the work that is being done *right now*. You're correct to assess that much of the existing "organized" communist movement is rife with those same errors, including collaborationism -- but why would you not also apply that analysis to organized labor?
