# s such a weird cultural stigma against frozen food, but it

@SxLongshadow Yes, there's such a weird cultural stigma against frozen food, but it's honestly ridiculous. Modern flash freezing techniques preserve fruits and vegetables so well that they're largely indistinguishable in terms of nutrition, texture, and taste. @SxLongshadow For me, fresh produce is for the stuff that you usually can't find frozen. And of course, that's for the occasions when I have the energy for that. Keeping a stock of frozen veggies and canned beans is critical.
