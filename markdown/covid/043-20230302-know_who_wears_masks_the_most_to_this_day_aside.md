# know who wears masks the most to this day , aside from...

You know who wears masks the most to this day, aside from people who are highly-vulnerable, highly-informed on the science, or know people who are?

It's people who really can't afford to get laid out for 1, 2, 3 or more weeks. "Just a flu" could still wreck you financially. You have never needed to be obsessively researching what COVID can do to say "Nope, not doing that. Everyone's getting sick, I'm not risking it."
