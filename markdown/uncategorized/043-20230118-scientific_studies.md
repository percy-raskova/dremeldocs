# scientific studies

On one hand, most people don't know how to critically read scientific studies and translate their findings to clinical application.

On the other hand, most doctors don't even *bother* to read those studies at all, and just discount everything they weren't taught in med school. https://t.co/QNtuMkokVo So yes, Google your symptoms, read the studies. Maybe look them over with a friend. Bring your findings to the doctor. If they dismiss you out of hand... find a new doctor? If they are willing to actually discuss what you brought them, they're probably worth your time. Never discount the power of an expert who is comfortable saying "Huh. I didn't know about that. I'll look into it." You don't lose your credibility by demonstrating willingness to learn.
