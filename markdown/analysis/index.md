# Unmasking Capital's Mystifications

This section documents the ideological combat against bourgeois hegemony. These threads expose how capital mystifies its own violence, revealing the material base beneath every cultural formation, every political maneuver, every manufactured crisis.

## Battlegrounds of Class War

### Fascism Analysis
**100 threads** exposing fascism as capitalism's emergency response to revolutionary threat. Not moral failing or mass delusion but the *material organization of oppressor-nation interests* against liberation movements. These analyses strip away liberal mystifications about "extremism" to reveal fascism's function: preserving capital accumulation through systematized terror.

*The fascist resurgence isn't aberration—it's capitalism working exactly as intended.*

### Cultural Criticism
The superstructure isn't floating above material relations—it's the *battlefield* where hegemony reproduces itself. These threads demonstrate how cultural production naturalizes exploitation, individualizes structural oppression, and transforms revolutionary impulses into commodified rebellion. Culture doesn't "reflect" capitalism; it *actively constructs* the subjects capitalism requires.

*Every cultural artifact is a site of class struggle.*

### COVID & Public Health Politics
**140 threads** revealing pandemic management as *deliberate* class warfare. Not policy failure but conscious sacrifice of working bodies for capital accumulation. The virus exposed what was always true: public health under capitalism means managing how many workers capital can afford to lose while maintaining profitability.

*Eugenics isn't historical aberration—it's capitalism's permanent logic.*

## Materialist Method as Revolutionary Weapon

These analyses don't "apply theory"—they *weaponize* historical materialism against ruling class ideology. This isn't academic exercise but necessary reconnaissance for revolutionary struggle.

The method is straightforward: identify the economic base, name the class forces, trace the historical development, expose the hegemonic function. Every mystification crumbles when subjected to materialist analysis because *material reality cannot ultimately be obscured by ideology*.

## The Dialectical Unity of Oppression

Fascism, cultural hegemony, and pandemic eugenics aren't separate phenomena requiring interdisciplinary study. They're *unified expressions* of capitalism in crisis:

- **Fascism** mobilizes oppressor-nation solidarity when redistribution threatens
- **Culture** manufactures consent when coercion becomes too visible
- **Public health** manages the contradiction between labor power and its expendability

Understanding their interconnection isn't academic insight—it's strategic necessity for revolutionary organizing.

## Revolutionary Purpose

This analysis exists for one reason: to sharpen our capacity for organized resistance. Every thread here serves the same function—stripping away the mystifications that prevent revolutionary consciousness from crystallizing into revolutionary organization.

We don't analyze to understand. We analyze to *destroy* what exists and *build* what must replace it.
