# my new followers

I feel like I should clarify something for some of my new followers:

You will often hear me decry "liberals" and "liberalism." You may very well consider yourself a liberal, because you are not a conservative, but that is not the political framework I'm coming from. Liberalism is a distinct political ideology that emerged hundreds of years ago, and can be summed up as the ideology of the bourgeoisie. It is primarily concerned with the rights of the individual as having primacy over the rights of the community -- especially property rights. Liberalism rose to prominence in Europe during the protracted, messy, violent period of transition from feudalism to capitalism. It helped the ascendant bourgeoisie coalesce into a political class with coherent goals, strategies, tactics, and identities. They built nation states, established constitutions, purged the old aristocratic classes, and deeply ingrained newly-hegemonic cultural norms. As European colonialism ramped up, liberalism came to dominate the planet. To this day, liberalism predominates. It is hegemonic. "Conservatism" on the other hand, is not a distinct political ideology, but rather an *orientation*. It is characterized by reaction, the desire to preserve the existing social order, or return to a mythologized perception of a social order that has been lost. In the beginning of the conquest of liberalism, it was a progressive ideology, seeking to overturn the existing social order, often through violence. Now that it has *become* the existing social order, liberalism has necessarily become a conservative ideology. There are, of course, many strains of liberalism: political factions that have emerged out of various countervailing tendencies within the overall hegemony, each vying for dominance. What you think of as "conservatism" is one of them. "Progressivism" is another. The different strains of liberalism are all conservative at their core, just with different ideas about *how* to preserve bourgeois society. While I am *less* disgusted by the strains that are *less* hostile to my existence, I'm still fundamentally opposed to liberalism *itself*. So, even though I rail against liberals all the time, don't be offended. I'm talking about the entire liberal, capitalist, imperialist hegemony. Even if you identify yourself as "liberal," there is probably a very good reason you followed me in the first place: you dissent. You refuse to be complacent. You are NOT conservative. You want to see a fundamental shift in the way society works. And on that, we agree.

Of course, there is much more to building a political movement than just agreeing that we want change. I'm a communist: specifically, a Marxist-Leninist. If you stick around, it'll become very clear exactly what that means and why I embrace that ideology. I don't care if that's not *your* ideology, as long as you refuse to be complacent, are always growing, and are ready to fight.
