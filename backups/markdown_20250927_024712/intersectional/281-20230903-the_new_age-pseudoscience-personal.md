# the new age-pseudoscience-personal...

A lot of "leftists" underestimate the new age-pseudoscience-personal liberty-paleo-revanchist-essentialist-relativist-eugenicist-white supremacist-fascist circuit, whose central unifying theme is anti-communism and anti-science being passed off as heroic self-determination. There is no reliable cure for this degradation: some pull themselves out, most do not, once they are sufficiently entrenched. The only prophylactic is fostering scientific literacy, historical materialism, and unshakable empathy for all the peoples of the world.
