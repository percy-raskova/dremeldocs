# @sammy4723 Couple things

@sammy4723 Couple things to note:

1) This study uses data from only the first year of the pandemic. Omicron might be *worse*, based on other cellular and epidemiological data.

2) When separated by age, patients &lt;60 had no higher risk 35 days after infection. @sammy4723 3) The study does not look at re-infections. Again, omicron completely changes the game here, with its various sublineages that are all excellent at evading prior immunity.

4) They couldn't examine vaccination status as part of their analysis, since this cohort comes so early. @sammy4723 5) The specific causes of death they looked at *are* known, using more recent data, to have elevated hazard risk, even across demographics such as age or vaccination status.

So while we can extrapolate from there, we don't have the hard data yet.
