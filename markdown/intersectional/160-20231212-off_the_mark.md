# off the mark

@RodericDay This is the same guy who called my very measured observations of the recent MUG congress completely "off the mark," and dismissed it out of hand as being a product of my own ideology.

(The ideology in question? Wanting an actual revolutionary party üôÑ)

https://t.co/RUR6w52CMR @RodericDay I probably need to update my assessment, given some of the stuff I've seen from certain MUG folks since then. Maybe a Leninist faction could form within this DSA "faction" to combat the Kautskyism üßê
