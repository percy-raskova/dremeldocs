# any religious text

To be fair, it's hilarious that we let anyone believe that any religious text is history. https://t.co/HRqhcZwRLH (Also I was raised super religious, and was taught over and over the mantra "the Torah is not a history book," but that was primarily meant as a way to excuse the obvious inaccuracies and internal inconsistencies. Everyone just treated the overall narrative as historical anyway.)
