# feds literally banged on my door at 7 AM to interrogate me...

The feds literally banged on my door at 7 AM to interrogate me over a meme I posted of Joe Biden with a red triangle over his head. I have basically no "social media footprint," and I'm certainly not publicly bragging about committing a felony. https://t.co/7MO3zRziGG None of this necessarily means they're federal agents, it just means they're absolutely not seen as an active threat by the regime. They're LARPers. For all their bluster and bravado, they have done and will never do anything to harm US imperial interests.
