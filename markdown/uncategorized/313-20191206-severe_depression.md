# severe depression

@BernieSanders I spent the better part of a decade avoiding treatment for severe depression, and it almost killed me, because I had no idea how to navigate the system. My mother had to do it for me. If I could have just walked into any psychiatrist's office and gotten treatment, I would have. @BernieSanders The true freedom afforded by universal coverage is absolutely necessary for people whose mental illness saps their energy to slog through bureaucracy.

If I had to jump through the same hoops to get groceries, I would have starved.
