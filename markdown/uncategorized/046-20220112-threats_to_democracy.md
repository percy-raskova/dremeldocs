# threats to democracy

There is nothing more infuriating than hearing Democrats scold about "threats to democracy." Because they're right about that surface level fact, but wrong about literally everything else: the causes, the final outcomes, how we get there. It's like listening to a three-year-old explaining why it rains. They know that sometimes the clouds get darker, but that's about it.
