# the primary deviation

Hero worship is not the primary deviation holding back revolution in the imperial core, but rather an unwillingness to engage with historical socialism. Misinformed as they are by propaganda and obfuscation, westerners are far more likely to abhor than extol past revolutionaries. https://t.co/WyV9vyaHIu Criticize them, yes.
