# every surface protein

@socialistboomer Ah yes, in that case, yes, your body will produce antibodies to every surface protein (viruses don't have cells, btw). However, the point still stands that variants absolutely can emerge that evade antibodies due to having surface proteins that are significantly different. @socialistboomer The mu variant, for example, has been shown to have mutations that allow it to evade both vaccine- and infection-derived immunity.

I do agree with the assessment that boosters of the exact same vaccine probably won't help that much. But *modified* vaccines for new strains would.
