# a colonial occupation

@OpenlyReasoned Again, "Israel" refers to a colonial occupation, not an ethnic group. "Wiping out Israel" is like "wiping out Jim Crow."

I can barely even begin to explain how wrong your description of Palestinian rights in Israel is. For one thing, Palestinians don't have the right of return. @OpenlyReasoned The formation of "Israel" included hundreds of thousands of Palestinians being forcibly evicted from homes their families had lived in for centuries. They and their descendants are not able to return. Meanwhile, anyone with even a drop of Jewish blood is given instant citizenship
