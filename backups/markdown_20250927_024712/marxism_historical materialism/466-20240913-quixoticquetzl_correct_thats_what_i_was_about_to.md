# @QuixoticQuetzl Correct, that's what I was about to say

@QuixoticQuetzl Correct, that's what I was about to say. The theoretical tools developed 2 centuries ago need to be adapted to contemporary circumstances, and many of those tools are more applicable to understanding the precariat, and less so to the broader proletariat -- for now... @QuixoticQuetzl The expansion of imperialism came with the expansion of a labor aristocracy that does not line up evenly with the more precarious working class that older Marxists wrote about. However, fascism serves to expand the precariat to ever-increasing proportions of the working class.
