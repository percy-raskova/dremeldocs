# Welcome to propaganda 101 

Welcome to propaganda 101!

Step 1: Call what the *other* side does "propaganda," which is devious. What you do is "reporting," which is noble.

Step 2: Mute it! Lots of meddlesome bilingual people out there will try to use the actual words being spoken to distort your message. https://t.co/ug6eWgvwYd Step 3: Use neutral-sounding terms that still highlight the aspects of the footage that help convey an implicit message, such as noting that the enemy is "masked" and "using body language."

Step 4: Call female enemies men, if you can get away with it. Men are scary. Step 5: Allow your audience to "draw their own conclusions," confident in the knowledge that your subtle word choices, like "put his arm around a child," have successfully colored a normal, human gesture of comfort as aggressive and barbaric.
