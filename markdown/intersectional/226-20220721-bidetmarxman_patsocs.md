# @bidetmarxman Patsocs

@bidetmarxman Patsocs are wholly irrelevant. They do not actually organize. They're not in workplaces, apartments, homeless shelters, food banks, etc. building solidarity based on material needs. We can deal with them if they actually start posing a threat to real communist organizing. @bidetmarxman If you ever try to organize someone, and they mention that they saw and were intrigued by some patsoc bs, *that's* who you should be talking to to deconstruct patsoc views. Internet weirdos aren't going to change their minds anyway.
