# If you live in the imperial core, this is on you

@PuppygirlMao "If you live in the imperial core, this is on you" is just as ludicrous a claim as "If you live in China, their inaction is on you"

There objectively is a LOT more that China could be doing. I understand *why* they don't, strategically and tactically, I just disagree with them. @PuppygirlMao There's a huge difference between "China is just as bad as the US. They are evil imperialists, furthering this genocide out of callous self-interest" and "China is really disappointing everyone right now with their inaction."
