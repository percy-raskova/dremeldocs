# Many revolutionaries

@SherylWeikalLaw Many revolutionaries have fallen into the trap of not examining and eradicating their own pre-existing biases. Still more lapsed into conspiratorial thinking--reactionary elements are trying to take down the revolution, so I need to suss out who could be working with them! @SherylWeikalLaw Yes, those reactionary forces were really out to get them! But you are a complete fool to believe that the exact marginalized groups the revolution necessarily uplifts are somehow "more likely" to be CIA assets. Don't oppress them and they'll have no reason to work against you!
