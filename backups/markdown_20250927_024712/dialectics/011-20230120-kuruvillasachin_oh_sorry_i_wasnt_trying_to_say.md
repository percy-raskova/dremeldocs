# @KuruvillaSachin Oh sorry, I wasn't trying to say your...

@KuruvillaSachin Oh sorry, I wasn't trying to say your hypothesis is wrong, just provide the data you asked for. That could absolutely account for some of the effect, and it would explain why the trends reversed when parents had to return to work. @KuruvillaSachin Obviously all of this is complicated. But my overall point is that for years, people have just been repeating an unfounded myth about how lockdowns ruined children's lives, when that simply isn't the case.
