# stop worrying about hypotheticals, people are already being...

This framing of "stop worrying about hypotheticals, people are already being brutalized!" ignores the fact that people are *also* already being brutalized *here*. To borrow a phrase, it "erases the very real terrorism oppressed people are being subjected to by the US empire." https://t.co/RmkcfbYihU Over the past decade alone, there have been dozens of uprisings that have been *brutally* repressed, using technology and tactics developed across the empire's many laboratories. Every instance of state terror across the entire empire contributes to their corpus of knowledge. Municipal police departments, military detachments, intelligence agencies, extrajudicial paramilitaries, and yes, colonial outposts such as the occupation in Palestine, all collaborate, cross-grain, and contribute to the same manual of standard operating procedures of repression. They work tirelessly to develop these techniques, incorporating what works and discarding what doesn't, all with the unified goal of violently maintaining bourgeois hegemony. Their operational strategy focuses primarily on the nationally oppressed, regardless of imperial borders. Within the so-called United States proper, that particularly includes indigenous, black, and immigrant populations. They also target the broader precariat, to the extent that there is any measure of cohesive collective identity and unity of action. If we had an organized communist movement here, we would of course be targeted with a commensurate level of coordinated repression, rather than the sporadic sniping and frankly lazy infiltration we see now. So that repression is focused on cohorts likely to *become* organized. Or, as in the case of Palestinian resistance, cohorts that already *are* organized to the stage of military action.

When we say "It will happen here," we're not moaning over the hypothetical of repression. We're stating as a matter of fact: we WILL organize. We WILL face this. The occupation of Palestine and the repression wrought on the resistance objectively *is* a laboratory. That's not a statement of selfish fear, it's an empirical assessment, necessary for doing our *own* science. They are constantly innovating, and we need to innovate in turn.
