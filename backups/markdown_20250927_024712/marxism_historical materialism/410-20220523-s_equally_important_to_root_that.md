# s equally important to root that 

@EclecticRadical Yes, but it's equally important to root that "consciousness" in actual material improvement. Hence, the revolution needs to be centered around building its own, organized infrastructure for production and distribution of necessities as well as military protection from fascists. @EclecticRadical Hence the centrality of union organizing *by revolutionaries*. With a sufficient coalescence of resources and organizational capacity, the revolution can be a material force aiding rank-and-file organizing, building up an economic infrastructure for feeding/protecting the people.
