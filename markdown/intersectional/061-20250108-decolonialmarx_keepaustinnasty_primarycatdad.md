@DecolonialMarx @keepaustinnasty @primarycatdad No, he is. He just legitimately thinks Marxism and decolonization are mutually exclusive, because Marx was white. @DecolonialMarx @keepaustinnasty @primarycatdad He "disputes" the claim that explicitly Marxist decolonial movements are a thing because "Well, they eventually moved beyond Marxism and started collectivizing. And suggesting otherwise is racist." @DecolonialMarx @keepaustinnasty @primarycatdad His second "dispute" is that Walter Rodney's Decolonial Marxism was "highly focused on economics" and "not every theorist knows everything." No explanation of what is actually *wrong* with Rodney, or what else needs to be considered that somehow overrules the economic angle. @DecolonialMarx @keepaustinnasty @primarycatdad And then he goes on to presume that Marxists believe 1776 was "decolonial," and pretty much spends the rest of the video shadowboxing with that strawman. @DecolonialMarx @keepaustinnasty @primarycatdad Can someone who isn't blocked let Rick know that there is not a single legitimate Marxist who sees "maga communists" as anything other than the fascists they are?

This is literally just "Nazis were socialists -- it's right there in the name: National SOCIALISTS" tier nonsense. https://t.co/emaxjB5KEG
