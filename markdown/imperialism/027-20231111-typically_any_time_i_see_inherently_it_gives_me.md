# Typically, any time I see "inherently," it gives me pause

@NiaFrome Typically, any time I see "inherently," it gives me pause. But in this case, of course settler-colonialism is inherently more genocidal, definitionally. In the same way that 4 is an inherently larger number than 3. @NiaFrome If there was "another form of colonialism" that attempted to be *more* genocidal, that would have to involve wiping out literally every single person -- rather than just *trying* to do so. And then what do you do with the land you have emptied out? You settle it.
