# Why don

"Why don't you Americans do something about it instead of begging China to help?"

Well see, the thing is, I, regrettably, do not have any missiles to send to Palestine, nor do I have an annual budget of trillions of dollars.

We don't even have a real communist party here. Give me a bomb, I will strap myself to it and fire it at DC. What are we even talking about here??? https://t.co/LzWSxAO9D7 So yeah, I am "doing something." I'm trying to help build a revolutionary movement that *does not currently exist* beyond a few groups of isolated, underdeveloped activists. It will take us YEARS to get to point of being able to even get close to where the resistance is already.
