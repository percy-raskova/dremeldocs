# @jasonhickel I have a question about this study

@jasonhickel I have a question about this study. There is a demonstrable flow of embodied labor from China to the imperial core, which is why it makes sense to group China with the global south -- but what does the flow look like with China compared to the *rest* of the south? @jasonhickel That is, if we disaggregate non-core economies and temporarily ignore the flow to the core, what are the dynamics like? I'd imagine larger economies like China act as "intra-south net importers." If so, what's the magnitude, and how does it compare to the core-periphery exchange? @jasonhickel I tried searching through the primary data, but I couldn't quite find the specific, granular data I was looking for.
