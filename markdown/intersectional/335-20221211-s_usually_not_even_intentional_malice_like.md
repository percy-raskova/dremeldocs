# s usually not even intentional malice, like 

@bmore_radical It's usually not even intentional malice, like "Hehe, I can't wait for you to get sick so I can make more money!" It's about class interest and cultural hegemony. It's about the types of personalities and socioeconomic backgrounds that are allowed to make it into the system. @bmore_radical It's about filtering out dissent, scientific curiosity, and empathy. And even when "good doctors" make it through, they're in the minority, and are sidelined or otherwise kept socially powerless. There is no fixing this within the capitalist system.
