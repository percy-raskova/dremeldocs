# Essentialism is so wild

Essentialism is so wild. Social constructs have no basis in the natural world. 0.001% variation in the human genome and people start acting like there are "natural racial hierarchies." Lmao what. Millions of years spent buck-ass naked and now you wanna try telling me skirts are genital-specific?

Care to show me where on the X chromosome "feminine" names are coded for? Those names we came up with like 2 centuries ago? What the fuck is a "nation"?? You didn't evolve to be a "Croatian" bro, you evolved to eat fruit and use rocks to crack open nuts.
