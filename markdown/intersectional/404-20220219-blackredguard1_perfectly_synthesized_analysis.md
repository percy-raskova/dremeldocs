# @BlackRedGuard1 Perfectly synthesized analysis

@BlackRedGuard1 Perfectly synthesized analysis.

I will point out that it's not just newbie leftists falling for this. Richard Wolff has been a (academic ðŸ™„) Marxist for decades, and he supports them. He put out a video recently, full of facile arguments. Think I might do a debunk at some point. @BlackRedGuard1 He gets probably the closest you could get to a real analysis while still being very, very wrong for like 11 minutes straight.
