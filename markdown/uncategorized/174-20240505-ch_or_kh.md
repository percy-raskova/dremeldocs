# ch or kh

ح
represents the voiceless pharyngeal fricative, which is phonetically closer to the voiceless glottal fricative ("h" in English and "ה" in Hebrew) than it is to the voiceless uvular fricative ("ch or kh" in English and "ח or כ" in Hebrew). https://t.co/DWjkplPHx1 Although the ancestral form of ח WAS once the pharyngeal form, modern Hebrew has merged it with כ, with the old phoneme disappearing from use altogether. Think of how English once had Þ, but now must use the digraph "th" to represent that phoneme. Pronunciations change. It's silly to map a missing phoneme directly onto an existing one, simply because the letter used to represent the extant sound used to be pronounced differently. There are many ways to indicate that a missing phoneme *would* be used there -- such as the "kh" digraph for ח The reason people mock this particular transposition is that it feels intentional. Without the ability to pronounce the voiceless pharyngeal fricative, it would be just as easy to pronounce it with the glottal, just like English speakers do for everything past the velar fricative Pronouncing it as "Khamas" comes across as deliberately trying to distinguish themselves from both English and Arabic pronunciation, to play up their "levantine credentials." Despite, as noted, the clear absence of the ancestral phoneme found in both Arabic AND ancient Hebrew. (It's also not really that hard to pronounce the voiceless pharyngeal fricative, especially if you can already do the uvular. Lack of effort, skill issue, etc.)
