# ve been reading COVID studies since January 2020, but it

I've been reading COVID studies since January 2020, but it's only been in the past few months that I've been studying its viral cousins.

Y'all. All of this was predictable. Airborne transmission. Immune dysfunction. Infection of multiple organ systems. Persistence. All of it. The only difference between SARS-CoV-2 and its cousins is that it is much, MUCH better at doing what coronaviruses do. I wasn't an expert, so everything I say, I say in hindsight. But those experts exist, and they were sounding the alarm from the beginning. It is absolutely unforgivable the way the WHO, the CDC, and every western state chose to deliberately bury the hard-fought knowledge of the beast we were about to face.

And now you know why China has adhered so religiously to Zero COVID. Because they actually listened.
