# @elenigiorgos @jessezwick Redlining

@elenigiorgos @jessezwick Redlining, white flight, and suburbanization cannot be disentangled from market forces. Historical redlining was driven by banks excluding financial services from zones with high minority populations because they were perceived as high risk markets. @elenigiorgos @jessezwick Modern redlining continues that exact same pattern, just without specifically naming the racial makeup of those excluded zones.

White flight was driven by wealthier citizens moving to the suburbs because they perceived that as a "safer investment": another racist market force. @elenigiorgos @jessezwick These things haven't gone away, and they are present across every city in this country. The words used have changed, but the sentiment is still there: Spend more on this housing because it's a "safe neighborhood" and "schools are good" and "property values will increase."
