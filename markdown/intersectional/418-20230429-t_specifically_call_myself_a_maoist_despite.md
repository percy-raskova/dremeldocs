# t specifically call myself a Maoist, despite agreeing with...

@DetroitRbg I feel like a Twitter thread is not the best place to hash out why I don't specifically call myself a Maoist, despite agreeing with Mao's theoretical work. But at least part of it has to do with an aversion to the "Person-ism" naming scheme as a whole. @DetroitRbg "Communist" would work best if there weren't a million deviations calling themselves that, forcing us to specify. (Not that there aren't also a bunch of ideologically deficient, chauvinist, imperialist chuds donning "Marxist-Leninist," as if they had any right to that title).
