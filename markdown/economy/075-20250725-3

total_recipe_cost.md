# $3

Total recipe cost

Italian sausage: $5
Shallot and garlic: $1
Tomato paste: $1
Vodka: $2
Heavy cream: $5
Parmesan: $3
Pasta: $3

Total recipe cost is $20 and that makes 4 servings.

Grate in an entire wedge of imported, authentic parmigiano reggiano and you're MAYBE looking at $40 for 4 servings. https://t.co/321u5bvO4R Nice try, deflecting with sizzle words like "cooking down," "browning," and "deglazing," but I am actually a great home chef, and I can tell you that technique don't cost a thing. You don't deglaze with an entire bottle of top shelf liquor, you just need a quick glug. There is no calculus that can ever make eating at a restaurant cheaper than making it yourself. The restaurant also has to pay for ingredients, but then on top of that, they have to pay for staff, facilities, marketing, and of course, take home a tidy profit. All you're saving is time. It's ok to admit that. Just say the words: "I would rather spend $60 on a meal than spend time shopping, cooking, and cleaning."

That, or admit you're deliberately seeking out the most expensive ingredients you can and then throwing away the leftovers.
