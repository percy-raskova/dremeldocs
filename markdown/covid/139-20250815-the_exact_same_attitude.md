# the exact same attitude

Oh right, I can't believe I forgot to berate DSA for having the exact same attitude toward COVID as the Democratic Party. https://t.co/YTvhPCzgCT They actively voted on it. They put mass health to a vote and it failed. They asked themselves "Where do we stand on this issue?" and answered "In lockstep with the status quo we claim to oppose."

"Please stop spreading disease" was met with "C'mon man, you're ruining the vibe!" I can't wait for "certain folks" to find this and launch their hilariously impotent rage against the brick wall that is scientific certainty. Their only argument is "I don't wanna ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­"

At a certain point you have to ask yourself who your "comrades" are.
