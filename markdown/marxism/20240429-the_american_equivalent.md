# the American equivalent

Haz and Hinkle are the American equivalent of Zionists. The ideology of the US settler colonial empire was copy-pasted and applied directly to the occupation of Palestine, which is propped up as its outpost. Hinkle attempts to invert this relationship and present Zionism as... https://t.co/VSFjAKB8fV ... a conspiracy, puppeteering an otherwise beneficent United States. This is a fascist schema, pointing to the most unavoidable contradictions and collapsing them into a single, readily-propagated "subversion" that can be extracted without challenging the extant hierarchy. The central project of "patsocs" is to retain colonial relations and bourgeois hegemony, while isolating all oppressed groups whose liberation necessitates the destruction of that hegemony. They do so while adopting a vaguely communist patina to foster aesthetics over revolution. To answer the question of "Who are you??" I'm an actual Marxist. I also happen to be a member of several of the groups Hinkle and his fascist ilk would see destroyed. The real liberation movement recognizes the material interaction of all these forces and seeks to eliminate them.
