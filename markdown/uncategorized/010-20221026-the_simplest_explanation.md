# The simplest explanation

@CaniTerrae The simplest explanation is not that we're "the first," but that alien civilizations are just beyond our spatial-temporal bubble. A civilization that reached the stars 10,000 years ago, 50,000 light years away. Or millions of years ago and millions of light years away. @CaniTerrae With our current understanding of physics, there is simply no way for an object with any mass to travel at the speed of light, let alone *faster*. We wouldn't even see their EM patterns for a million years if they're a million light years away.
