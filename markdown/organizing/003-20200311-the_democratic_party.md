# the Democratic party

Even if you honestly still believe the Democratic party can be changed from the inside, you *must* realize that a third party is still necessary for that. If you have no other option but to go with the establishment or stay home, they'll never give you any concessions. Your only non-Dem option is staying home, and both parties feel safe ignoring non-voters. What would happen if there was a viable, national third-party, and the Democrats fronted Joe Biden against? All the leftists would have something to vote for in December.

The results?
Trump: 45%
Biden: 40%
Third Party: 15% The response?

"Oh my GOD, these toxic Bernie Brosâ„¢ just gave Trump another term! We need to come together as a party if we want to stop another Trump from happening!" The response to that response?

"Party unity? What party? I'm not a Democrat, and I never will be, as long as Democrats stand against Medicare for All, stand for eternal war, etc." If they want to remain relevant, they HAVE to meet us where we are. If they fail to do this, 15 years from now, this new left party will be invigorated with almost all Millennials and Zoomers, while the Democrats will be a vestigial remnant of a darker time.
