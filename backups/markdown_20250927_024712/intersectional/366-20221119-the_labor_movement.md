# the labor movement

It's obviously very concerning that the labor movement in general has ceded ground on the pandemic. It's also hilariously absurd to suggest "And therefore it is my moral right and duty to cross a picket line!" Working Class liberation is the ONLY path out of this pandemic. https://t.co/OwQ1oANpOw Also, I'm sick of having to say this, but COVID safety is not just about protecting people with disabilities. We are ALL in danger. COVID ravages your immune system. It *creates* disability.

This is an opportunity to educate. Go to picket lines, hand out N95s, and explain why. Liberalism has so totally destroyed the brains of so many people that we think "liberation" means "I get to do what I want." You are not being oppressed by a picket line. *They* are being oppressed by cultural hegemony that has thoroughly erased COVID from their consciousness. I don't know why I'm bothering to "refute" someone who is obviously not trying to contribute anything, and just wants to scold without educating and detract without contributing.

But just like many Twitter "discourse" dumpster fires, there was a kernel of truth to highlight. I think maybe I should do some sort of (free) seminar or consultation circuit to help educate labor activists about COVID and the critical relevance of both workplace protection and personal safety. Public health is a labor issue. Solidarity is a labor issue.
