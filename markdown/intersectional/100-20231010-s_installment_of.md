# s installment of 

In today's installment of "The West Just Can't Stop Praising Fascists," we have Ezra Yachin, former member of Lehi, a far-right paramilitary that committed innumerable atrocities against Palestinians, including the gut-churning Deir Yassin massacre.l https://t.co/boj1kJC62f Lehi had its roots in the explicitly fascist Brit HaBirionim, who styled themselves after the Italian Fascist Party. Eventually, Lehi was absorbed into the "IDF," when it came time to institutionalize the anti-Arab pogroms in 1948.

https://t.co/WkBh8rCyf2 To see news outlets call this man taking up arms again "a testament to the strength of the human spirit" is truly disgusting. It is a testament to the worst aspects of humanity: the willingness to commit atrocities for the sake of a theocratic ethnostate.
