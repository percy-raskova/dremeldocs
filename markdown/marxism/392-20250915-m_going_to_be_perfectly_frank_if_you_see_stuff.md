# m going to be perfectly frank: if you see stuff like this...

I'm going to be perfectly frank: if you see stuff like this and think it's cool, you're showing your petty bourgeois colors. The lower classes can smell bullshit a mile away, especially the "Look, we're using tools, we're just like you!" stuff that every smarmy carpetbagger does. https://t.co/4Astu2Cy4g It's actually hilarious how embarrassing and insincere this stuff is.

You can absolutely fit in if you come from an upper class background, but the only way to do it is by being *sincere*. We can tell who's using bourgeois-to-prole Google Translate and who is actually fluent.
