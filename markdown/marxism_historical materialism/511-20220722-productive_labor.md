# productive labor

@yeongno3 The Marxist view: "productive labor" is that which produces more than is required to survive, and it's applied on a societal scale. In a society which produces enough for everyone to survive *and* has "extra" jobs such as baristas, everyone's labor is considered productive. @yeongno3 I should say "a society which produces *and distributes* enough for everyone to survive." A capitalist society in which basic necessities are guarded behind the violence of markets can produce extreme surpluses and still leave people struggling to even produce enough to survive.
