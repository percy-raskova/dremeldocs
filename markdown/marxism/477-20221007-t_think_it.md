# t think it

I don't think it's *inherently* immoral to eat meat, but the lives of factory-farmed animals are mass, industrial-scale torture. I at least try to limit my meat consumption, but... it's kinda hard to compete with $2/pound of chicken, especially when I don't have any income. My soul dies a little when I see a whole rotisserie chicken selling for like $6. The entirety of the existence of that animal... boiled down to a few bucks.

I want lab-grown meat. I want it to be cheap, energy-efficient, and indistinguishable from "natural" meat. As a human, I care about humans the most. This isn't the *top* priority. But it is absolutely a source of great shame for humanity the way our food production relies on mass suffering. And it will never end under capitalism. Not while there's profit to be made.
