# opposing fascism with a broad coalition

Hilarious to put out an article bragging about doing the same shit for the past 20 years, running the treadmill of "opposing fascism with a broad coalition," and getting nowhere. The argument defeats itself. https://t.co/B62OQznjU9 "Look, I know it's not ideal, but [strategy that has demonstrably never worked] is the only option we have right now! It's more important now that ever that we [continue doing the thing that got us in this situation]!"
