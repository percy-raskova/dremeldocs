# some Russian ancestry

The funny thing about fascists trying to apply hot-off-the-grill anti-Russian slurs to me is that I *do* actually have some Russian ancestry. All of my great-grandparents fled antisemitic persecution across various eastern and central European countries, and met up in the US. I know intimately what your nationalism means. It was used as a tool to tear apart socialist states that had previously put an end to centuries of pogroms. It's not even a little shocking to see fascists carry the banner. Go be proud of your "national heritage" somewhere else. Basically what I'm saying is my gut reaction to "Haha Russian ðŸ«µ" is... yeah? And? You and your buddies have never seen me as anything other than an insidious alien element. Why would I give a shit what you think? At least I've been elevated in your mind from "vermin" to "orc."
