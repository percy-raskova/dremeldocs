# Not bacterial

"Not bacterial" yeah NO FUCKING SHIT

I was in the hospital for 8 days with a "mysterious" pneumonia, that they kept testing for various bacterial pathogens and treating with antibiotics. They never found the culprit, and never entertained the notion that it wasn't bacterial ðŸ™ƒ https://t.co/2M7D7ddfZH Bacteria dogma is as hegemonic as droplet dogma. Our healthcare system is absolutely fucked. Not a single one of the many nurses and doctors who came to treat me FOR AN UNKNOWN PNEUMONIA wore an actual respirator, and only about 10% of them even bothered with a surgical mask. "If you hear hooves, assume horse, not zebra." Ok, but you can't find a fucking horse, so maybe it's time to consider the possibility that zebras exist. And maybe you should have adapted somewhat in the past 5 years of a global zebra infestation.
