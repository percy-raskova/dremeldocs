# s literally just the same 

@_b_meyer It's literally just the same "arguments" creationists use to "disprove" evolution.

"Look at this thing that's so perfectly suited* to perform a specific function! There's no way this could have happened without conscious choice!"

*It's not even that perfect in the first place. @_b_meyer "Now that we've arbitrarily decided that this seems too unlikely to have happened without deliberate action, MY explanation must be true, even without positive evidence of a very specific and unprecedented event."
