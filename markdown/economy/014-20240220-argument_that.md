#  argument that 

Ah yes, the good ol' argument that "This thing that is happening right now is what would happen if you fail to maintain the present state of affairs." https://t.co/AHuHmxH8zC "But things will get worse under Trump!!"

Yeah, and they'll also get worse under Biden, round 2. We're seeing right now that Biden isn't stopping bad things from happening, nor has he articulated a single specific plan for how to stop it in the future.

There's no pitch here. Just the shittiest marketing strategy ever. Could you imagine if Hydrox was surging in popularity, and Oreo's big marketing push was just an ad showing someone eating a Hydrox cookie and going "Ugh, gross!"
