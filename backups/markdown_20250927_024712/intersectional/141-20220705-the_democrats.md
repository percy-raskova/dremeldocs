# the Democrats

You know how I know the Democrats are fundamentally unserious about the electoral system changing anything? Because all they say is "vote."

They don't say "work on campaigns."

They don't say "get your union to endorse."

They don't say "run for office."

They want you passive. Electoral organizing can't stop fascism. It can't end the ravages of capitalism. And the Dems know it.

All these electoral tools can help you do is oust leadership. And they know that too, and fight against it.

Just vote, though. Vote and feel good that you did all you could.
