# the global supply

Closing the strait of Hormuz and constricting the global supply of oil is a direct assault on the occupation of Palestine. It would arguably be even more effective at destroying the Zionist entity than all the missiles Iran has launched thus far. This is what the resistance has been calling for since the launch of Al Aqsa Flood: choke the oil, strangle the occupation. Israel cannot exist without imperial investment, and that investment is paid its dividends in oil. The primary role of the occupation is to keep the oil flowing. It is proving itself unable to do that.

That doesn't mean the US simply *gives up* on the region. It still needs energy and will do whatever it takes. But Israel itself may soon no longer be part of that equation.
