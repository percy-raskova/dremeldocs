# t actually have to say 

As Marxists, we don't actually have to say "I told you so" every time something we predicted happens. We don't have to say "This is actually not that hard to understand if you aren't a childish liberal" when someone points out something "contradictory." We can just... be right. People are learning, okay? Some learn faster than others. Some are piecing it together on their own. Some are noticing how often we're right. Some stay mired in liberal mythology, and will always see us as cranks. It's OK. Just keep educating those who will listen.
