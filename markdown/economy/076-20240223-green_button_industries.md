# Green Button Industries

Get a load of amateur hour over here ðŸ™„

Spend 6 months sitting on Green Button Industries, putting out ads, press releases, soliciting endorsements, and generating hype around this valuable product.

Go public with 2 million shares at $10/share. https://t.co/0WMExASzBv Continue to hold 60% of the shares during the initial trading phase, watching as the share price rises to meet inflated demand.

When the share price reaches the expected value of $12.5/share, immediately sell off all your shares. The rapid selloff will cause investors to panic, believing the button has secretly already been pressed and is worthless. Immediately begin short-selling as many shares as possible just before the green button market crashes. Expect shares to plummet below $5. At this point, you will have generated a profit of $7.5/share, manufactured out of thin air, without even pressing the button.

When you issue a press release demonstrating that the button has not been pressed, expect prices to rise again, more slowly this time. During this phase of slow growth, you should buy as many shares as you can afford, as quickly as possible, to simulate demand and push the price higher.

At this point, you can sell off shares above $10/share, or press the button, at your discretion. You can hold as long as you like, and there are plenty of market manipulations at your disposal to allow you to get way more than the expected value from the green button. At the end, you can always press the button, and if it produces nothing, write off the now-valueless shares you hold as a loss for Button Holdings Enterprises, the parent company you established to manage your broader investment portfolio.
