# Not knowing what being rich changes about it is *exactly*...

Not knowing what being rich changes about it is *exactly* what being rich changes.

There's an unbridgable gap, where your exceptional experience feels normal, and the constant strains of poverty seem, from the outside, to be "more or less the same" as the Rich Trans Experience. https://t.co/F1daTcv66Q It's not even just a question of "how easy has it been to transition?"

Sure, there's all the *things*, like hormones, surgery, fashion, etc. The accoutrements of presentation that wealth brings, helping buy you some peace through sheer "passability." There's also an extra layer of insulation from backlash. Never having to swallow the torment of an abusive workplace because you can't afford to quit. Never having to hide from a bigoted landlord who might illegally refuse a lease, knowing lawsuits are beyond your reach. Moreover, the unifying Trans Experience™️ is undercut by a divergence in class instincts. Where do your loyalties lie? Does your wealth orient you toward a protective impulse to the status quo that enriches you? Or do you feel every lick of oppression and seek its destruction? In the wealthy trans people, we can clearly see how it's possible to be advantaged in some ways by a system that still causes you harm. But how do you treat that harm? As an aberration that needs to be fixed? Or as a symptom of a terminal disease that must be expunged entirely? Not being able to see the gulf between the rich and the poor trans experience implies the former. The instinct is that being oppressed is made *somewhat* easier or harder based on how "fortunate" you happen to be, and that all that needs to change is a cultural shift. "If only our society would just learn to accept trans people, then rich and poor alike would be able to transition in peace!" That is a conclusion that can only come from wealth. It orients you in a distinctly non-oppositional direction to the status quo.

That is the difference.
