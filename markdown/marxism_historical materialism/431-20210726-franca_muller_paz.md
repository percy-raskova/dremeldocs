# Franca Muller Paz

@LisaMcCray The non-voters are soooo hard to reach. Franca Muller Paz ran on the Green ticket with exactly this sentiment in mind, and in the end, we basically only managed to pull about a quarter of the Dem voters away from Stokes and added a few percentage points on top with new voters. @LisaMcCray We didn't get started until after the Dem primary though, in case the classic "change outcomes by reforming the party" path worked out. But Stokes barely eked out a victory there. Convincing people better things are possible is ridiculously tough.
