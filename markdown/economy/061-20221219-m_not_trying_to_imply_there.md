# m not trying to imply there

@justinqtaylor Right, I'm not trying to imply there's ever a way to change society (for good or for bad) without building on what's already there. Societies, like species, *evolve* over time. There are revolutionary leaps, but they always work by modifying existing social forms. @justinqtaylor But "human nature" isn't set in stone. Our individual values are shaped in the context of a broader society--those values can get reinforced or repressed, and throughout our lives, our thought patterns and external behaviors become overdetermined by innumerable factors.
