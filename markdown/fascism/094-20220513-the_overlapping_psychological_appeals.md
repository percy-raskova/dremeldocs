# the overlapping psychological appeals

@BriannaWu It's important to understand the overlapping psychological appeals of fascism and cryptocurrency.

Desire for personal glory ✅
Heightened self/ingroup assessment ✅
Distrust in established social systems ✅
Susceptibility to charismatic "renegades" ✅
Crippling fear of loss ✅ @BriannaWu If you notice that these traits also fit certain types of people who call themselves "leftists," while eagerly aligning themselves with "right-wing populists," there is a good reason for that.
