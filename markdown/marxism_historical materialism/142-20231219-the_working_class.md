# the working class

@Boon_doggl They're "contradictory" because "exploitation of the working class" doesn't imply that the imperial working class receives any benefit through the particularities of imperialist extraction. It absolves the imperial core and allows us to pretend we can maintain those benefits. @Boon_doggl One is morally neutral, and allows for the presumption that the myriad ways the working class of the imperial core is advantaged by colonial extraction are simply "natural."

The other demands reckoning with the grotesque core-periphery and settler-indigenous economic imbalances.
