# @Zeronelite I wasn't implying anything of the sort

@Zeronelite I wasn't implying anything of the sort. "Think about [thing that is already true]" is a rhetorical tool to get people to start thinking about fascism as an extant, expansive force -- and the number of "I hadn't thought of this" comments demonstrates that it worked. @Zeronelite The fact that it's not super nuanced in its presentation is because it was an off-the-cuff tweet, not a fully fledged treatise.
