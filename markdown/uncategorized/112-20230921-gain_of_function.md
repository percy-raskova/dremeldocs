# gain of function

People who never heard the term "gain of function" before that conspiracy theory are gonna be really surprised when they find out what goes on in the vast majority of molecular biology labs on the planet.

It's such a common thing that we usually just say "GOF." It's not all about pathogens. In undergrad, I worked in a lab studying epigenetic gene regulation in yeast, and I investigated a potential GOF mutation that had arisen incidentally, as a brief tangent from the actual project. Nothing to do with infection, just yeast mating.
