# your working class org

If your working class org requires the payment of dues and an expectation of labor (which it should), it needs to have an explicit policy for the deferral/easement of either of those requirements. No one can be denied membership due to poverty or disability. (1/5) This deferral CANNOT take the form of substituting dues for additional labor or vice versa. That creates an environment in which poor or disabled members are punished for their circumstances with additional obligations beyond those of other members. (2/5) This is especially regressive and damaging to the organization in the context of the correlation between poverty and a lack of excess time/energy to contribute additional labor, and the correlation between disability and poverty. (3/5) A member who cannot afford dues must simply have that obligation deferred, with no further obligations -- they might then *volunteer* to contribute additional labor if they have the capacity to do so. (4/5) Same with those whose labor is deferred -- they might *choose* to contribute additional money if they have that capacity.

These deferrals could be partial or complete, tailored to the individual member's circumstances. But they cannot create additional hardship. (5/5)
