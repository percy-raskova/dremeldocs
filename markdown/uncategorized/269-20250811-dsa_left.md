# DSA Left™️

I might be singing a different tune if I saw any of the "DSA Left™️" treating the 43% vote as an extraordinary slap in the fact, rather than an unparalleled victory. And I'm sure the actual comrades I know struggling it out in DSA are thinking that way privately. I'd still say you're wasting your energy, fighting tooth and nail to wrest control of a liberal org, whose founding principles are directly opposed to your aims. But at least I'd know you aren't falling victim to cognitive dissonance, forcing you to rationalize this as "a win."
