# @yeongno3 Excellent question

@slugwave @yeongno3 Excellent question. Depending on the mode of production in each country, that productive labor can still rely on extractive and exploitative methods, like it does today. That doesn't really affect whether each step in the process is "productive labor" or not. @slugwave @yeongno3 Exploited foreign coffee farmers must still be producing at least enough to survive, otherwise the coffee industry would not survive. The commodification of their labor product abstracts the notion, since it might not otherwise be survivable within their home markets. @slugwave @yeongno3 Commodification also means that if individual workers do *not* survive this exploitation, the industry can still manage, as long as there is sufficient replacement for the lost labor. Hence why exploitation of the global south is much more brutal than in "wealthy" nations. @slugwave @yeongno3 Because of that extraction, the "productivity" can be seen by the capitalist as value beyond what they must compensate farmers to maintain the survival of that labor force. And that value is determined by the *domestic* market, not the market in the exploited region. @slugwave @yeongno3 Meaning that the farmers might *not* be able to survive by farming coffee and exchanging it in their home markets. As exploitative and brutal as this process is, global trade therefore still does increase those workers' productivity as an entire class. @slugwave @yeongno3 Hence why focusing on who is or is not "productive" is largely a pointless distraction. It flattens and erases the nuance of the nature of capitalist exploitation. It's being used here by patsocs as a purely aesthetic tool to try and exclude workers they have disdain for.
