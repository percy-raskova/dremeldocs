# long-term effects

@dgurdasani1 I will add that there were scientists warning about long-term effects as far back as early 2020. As soon as the disease had been widespread for months, researchers were pointing out people with months-long symptoms. It's the institutional disdain that quibbled over definitions. @dgurdasani1 Virologists familiar with SARS-1 already knew about its ability to cause chronic conditions, and there were papers put out pretty quickly showing the parallel.

But of course, these are tiny pinprick voices, screaming into a void of hegemonic antipathy for patient wellness.
