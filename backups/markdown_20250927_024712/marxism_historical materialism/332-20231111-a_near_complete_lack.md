# a (near) complete lack

@FoxyMarxist A huge part of the problem is a (near) complete lack of institutional support for that study. And whatever institutions do exist are almost invariably reformist or otherwise counter-revolutionary. Self-driven study is really hard for most people. @FoxyMarxist And those who try, but aren't doing so with a strong background of revolutionary fervor, often naively arrive at wrongheaded conclusions or a facile level of understanding.
