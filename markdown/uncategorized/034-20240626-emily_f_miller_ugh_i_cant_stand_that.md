# @emily_f_miller Ugh I can't stand that

@emily_f_miller Ugh I can't stand that. The amount of judgement I've gotten from people, simply for NOT moving out of Baltimore, because "Why would you CHOOSE to live there?" Fuck off. Let people LIVE. @emily_f_miller If anyone sardonically says "Welcome to Philly!" the first time you dare to complain about anything, you have my full support if you choose violence.
