# the Latino community

#WhenBerniewins, we should all be thanking @ChuckRocha for his tireless and overlooked role in inspiring hope in the Latino community. While everyone was busy pontificating about how Iowa is overwhelmingly white, not representative of the nation's diversity, questioning its relevance as the first in the nation, Chuck Rocha was out there fighting to organize the 6% of the population that's Latino. While the other campaigns were scrambling to consolidate the "all-important white vote," trying to eat away at each other's constituency, Chuck was out there building a new constituency.
