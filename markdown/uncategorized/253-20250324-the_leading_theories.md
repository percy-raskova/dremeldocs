# the leading theories

One of the leading theories behind the evolution of holometabolism (AKA complete metamorphosis) is that it emerged as a form of niche partitioning: caterpillars and butterflies/moths are so morphologically distinct that they eat different things and don't accidentally compete. https://t.co/lGRFtSwwhJ In other words, caterpillars and butterflies from the same species don't even recognize each other as being the same *thing*. The whole point of metamorphosis is to create a disjunction that separates larvae and adults into separate realms entirely. They don't interact at all. Imagine you lived in a society where it was just you and a bunch of other human kids -- also there are these giant winged beasts flying around, just one of the many kinds of animals you encounter every day. They don't talk to you, live with you, have anything in common with you. All a caterpillar knows is "Gotta eat. Gotta get big. Oh shit what's that thing??? Ok, back to eating."

Then they hit puberty, vomit a blanket to wrap themselves in, dissolve into goo, and now suddenly they ARE that thing.
