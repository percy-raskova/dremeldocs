# s left in the 

Here is what's left in the "Build Back Better" Act, and why it's essentially pointless:

1) Climate spending.

$55 billion/year in subsidies to drive the development of renewable energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, we'll continue to spend $720 billion/year subsidizing fossil fuels. 2) Childcare.

$67 billion/year for universal pre-k and means-tested childcare subsidies. This would be great if it lasted longer than the 6 pathetic years it's funded for. 3) Medicare expansion.

$3.5 billion/year to expand Medicare to cover hearing. No dental, no vision, and certainly no new people qualifying for the program. And again, this only lasts for 10 years. 4) Child tax credit.

$55 billion to give families making under $75,000 per adult a $3,000 tax rebate.

No, not $55 billion per year. 55 total, because it will literally only last for one year. 5) Housing.

$15 billion/year to build/improve 1 million public housing units. Again, pretty great.... and also woefully underfunded and only lasts for 10 years. Aaaand that's it! Completely irrelevant levels of climate spending, and then a bunch of little bandaids that would be great if they were evergreen.
