# @predederva Consistency

@predederva Consistency is good politics. So yes, it would be terrible politics to switch tactics 2 years into an administration. It would take a full-court press of information campaigns, community engagement, holding local officials accountable, and of course, acknowledging past mistakes. @predederva It is absolutely doable with the right strategy, in the same way past administrations have been able to rally the people behind WWII rationing, smallpox vaccination, and other projects. It will radicalize the hardcore denialists, who are already politically mobilized anyway. @predederva We can't be so defeatist that we just concede that the far-right will always be able to outmaneuver rational policy in the public arena. "Bad politics" is just bad implementation and messaging.
