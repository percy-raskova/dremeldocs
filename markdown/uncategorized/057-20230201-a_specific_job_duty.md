# a specific job duty

A timeline:

Friday: Coworker sets a time for him to train me on a specific job duty

Monday: Coworker comes in wearing a (surgical) mask for the first time since I met him. Confirms Tues. for training.

Tuesday: Email explaining that he's at home, and the training will be Wed. Today: Coworker still "under the weather," training will be virtual.

1 PM: Virtual training with cameras off, interspersed every 5 minutes by him muting, then going "... excuse me."

2 PM: "Alright, that should do it. See you tomorrow!"
