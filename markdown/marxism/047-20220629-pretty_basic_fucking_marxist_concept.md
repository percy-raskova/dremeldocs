# Pretty basic fucking Marxist concept

Pretty basic fucking Marxist concept:

Racism, sexism, bigotry in all forms are DEEPLY INTEGRATED into the class structure. This is a question of material liberation. Base and superstructure cannot be disentangled. Calling it "bourgeois culture war" is fundamentally anti-Marxist. Yes, communists throughout history who called queerness a bourgeois perversion were doing communism wrong. No, we don't have to paper over that.

Scientific socialism means learning from past experiments. That's how we beat the dogmatic and self-destructive ideology of capitalism
