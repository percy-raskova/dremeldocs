@oikeios @kevinredifer @atomicapproach @BizarrelyCoca If Russia had anywhere near the geopolitical heft or economic might of the U.S., I would be spending as much time decrying it as I do the current, much bigger problem. Capital, whether Russian or American, will never content itself with consuming merely *some* of the world. @oikeios @kevinredifer @atomicapproach @BizarrelyCoca Actually, to amend that, I would still spend more focus on the U.S., since that's where I live. Just like I don't spend as much time talking about European capital. I know the U.S. much more intimately, and am much better positioned to actually do anything about it.
