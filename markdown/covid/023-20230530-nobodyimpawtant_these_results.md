# @NobodyImpawtant These results

@NobodyImpawtant These results are encouraging, although I am a little concerned by the mouse trial measuring such a short time window (treatment up to 8 hours before or after infection). In the 8 hours trials, we start to see blips of virus in the lungs. Why didn't they test a longer time span? https://t.co/WG7OKwCy1T @NobodyImpawtant Would the idea be that you take this spray just before you go out and do something where you could be exposed, every time? That model would certainly not be pandemic-ending unless we mandated that every public place administers the spray for everyone who walked in.
