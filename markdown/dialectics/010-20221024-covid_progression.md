# COVID progression

@sleepyknave I mean yes, you can obviously describe COVID progression through the lens of dialectics. You can view the immune response dialectically. You can view the virus's suppression of MHC dialectically. You can view the molecular interaction between RNA and ribosome dialectically. @sleepyknave But like. These are all intellectual training wheels. Like characterizing the virus as "wanting" something.
