# an entire corporate cottage industry

Did you know there's an entire corporate cottage industry around analyzing the financial risk of various labor violations? The job of these consultants is to come up with a bottom line for how much wage theft, OSHA violations, and union busting corporations can get away with. They attach a number figure to the small chance of being prosecuted for these crimes, multiplied by the potential legal fees and eventual payout, then subtract that from the massive savings of doing the crime anyway.

The result is almost always a positive number. I say "consultants," but they're often just in-house lawyers, since it's an ongoing expense. And of course it's almost always worth it to have these exploitation specialists on payroll.
