# t talk enough about how the US committed one of the...

We don't talk enough about how the US committed one of the greatest war crimes in history, unleashing nuclear hell TWICE, just to preempt the USSR from mopping up Japan and "spreading communism." Just one of many, many such horrors done in the name of "containment." The brutality of anti-communism is orders of magnitude worse than anything you could hope to pin on communism itself, even ignoring the utter brutality of capitalism itself.
