# @SocialismS4A Krystal Ball

@SocialismS4A Krystal Ball, with her pathological need to find common ground with her reactionary co-host.

At least actual Canadian socdems like Rational National see the convoy as bullshit. @SocialismS4A I've maintained a policy that it's tactically important to keep an eye on what socdems are saying, since they're the largest non-reactionary contingent in the US. Turns out about 3/4 of them are actually reactionary anyway ðŸ¤·
