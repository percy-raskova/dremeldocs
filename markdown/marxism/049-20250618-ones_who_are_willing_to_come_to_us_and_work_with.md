# ones who are willing to come to * us * and work with us ,...

Who are our allies? The ones who are willing to come to *us* and work with us, no matter our principles. We set our feet and make it clear we won't buckle on those principles -- no chauvinism, no reformism, no collaboration with the state, etc. https://t.co/jD6FfJEkht Any prospective allies filter themselves based on their willingness to accept that. Chauvinists won't work with us if we make it clear opposing chauvinism is crucial. Same with reformists. With anarchists that *aren't* turned away by our principles, working with them is valuable. Obviously there are still necessary checks to be made after that, in terms of how we deal with our allies. But the primary check of "Here is what we unshakably stand for, call us if you're ok with that" is how we avoid watering down our mission for the sake of a facile "unity." And it ensures that any we are a part of actually serves that mission, with coalition members all being serious about their involvement. It lessens the need for handholding and cajoling to get immature "activists" to expand their horizons and avoiding scaring them off.
