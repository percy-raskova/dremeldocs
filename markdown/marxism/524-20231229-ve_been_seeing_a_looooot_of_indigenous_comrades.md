# ve been seeing a looooot of indigenous comrades being...

I've been seeing a looooot of indigenous comrades being bombarded with "leftist" race scientists lately. Like, way more than usual. ðŸ¤” You can't call yourself a Marxist if you don't understand common ancestry lmao. We're all cousins, bozo, and there is very little variation across humanity. Most variation is represented *within* any given population. https://t.co/ialSphdB1T
