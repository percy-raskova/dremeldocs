# Semitic languages

@tiredarabwoman The linguistic histories of Semitic languages are pretty complex, but Arabic and Hebrew didn't really descend from Aramaic. They took root separately in different places and times. Even this chart is oversimplified.

But yes, Aramaic was certainly the language of Roman Judea. https://t.co/jZE7ZVIGxi @tiredarabwoman Not that Zionists give a shit about history, obviously.

I was raised in what amounted to a Jewish Zionist cult, where we were taught that the Hebrew Bible is literally true, precedes the creation of the universe, and Hebrew was the language spoken by God ðŸ™„
