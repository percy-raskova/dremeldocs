# two state solution

@Rocko64_ At its core, the "two state solution" is a demand for Palestinians to be able to more holistically organize their resistance to the occupation. The goal is to be able to build a state infrastructure that can both provide for its people and mount a full war of liberation. @Rocko64_ Every revolution starts off in the guerilla mode, hampering and chasing out the enemy's holdings to secure territory. Holding that territory then becomes a matter of utmost importance, as the resistance expands its state-like character, providing for the needs of the people. @Rocko64_ This provides the logistical and productive engine of building a full state that will be able to take and hold the *entirety* of the territory held by the enemy. The resistance must abrogate the enemy's ability to extract any productive power from the territory they occupy.
