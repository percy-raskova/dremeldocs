# US military positioning/preparedness/psychopathic...

@swoletariat69 I think what they know has to do with US military positioning/preparedness/psychopathic willingness to escalate any regional conflict into a geopolitical nightmare scenario. China is certainly not ready for direct engagement with the beast. @swoletariat69 But seriously, money flows covertly alllll the time. Not that difficult to nudge things in the right direction.
