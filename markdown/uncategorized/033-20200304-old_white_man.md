# old white man

So here's the thing. Young voters OVERWHELMINGLY support progressive candidates, including the "old white man" who happens to want to tear down the establishment.

Even if we lose Super Tuesday, even if we lose the nomination, even if Trump gets 4 more years, change IS coming. The only problem is that, while a critical mass of young progressives is building, and will soon be insurmountable, we won't have an *overwhelming* mandate for a while. By the time the electorate is 60, 70%, it will be too late to just barely start addressing climate change.
