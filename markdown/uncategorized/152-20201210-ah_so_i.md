# Ah, so I

@UltVioletRae @DollyParton The only point of theory is for people to read it and go "Ah, so I'm *not* the only one who thinks this is bullshit." Everyone already knows everything is bullshit, they just need to realize that everyone agrees. @UltVioletRae @DollyParton And yes, 9-5 serves that same function without requiring people to slog through 1,100 pages about the price of bread.
