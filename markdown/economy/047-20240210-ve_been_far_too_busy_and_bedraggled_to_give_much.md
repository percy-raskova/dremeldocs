# ve been far too busy and bedraggled to give much of a shit...

I've been far too busy and bedraggled to give much of a shit about whatever people have been yelling about today, but I gather it's about exercise. So I'll just say this:

We, as a MOVEMENT, need a military.

You, as an INDIVIDUAL, have value beyond being a soldier. And "You can always push yourself to get stronger" leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, as someone deeply versed in the physiology and biochemistry of chronic fatigue, a condition that is rapidly swallowing a population being constantly reinfected with COVID. You CAN'T always get stronger with exercise. You might literally get weaker. You can exacerbate the chronic effects of long COVID -- a condition you might not even realize you have until you suddenly find yourself unable to run or hike as much as you used to. That is what the literature is revealing  as the canonical progression: individuals recovering from acute illness, getting "back on the grind," noticing they're a bit weaker now, pushing themselves to regain their losses, and steadily getting weaker and weaker. Sorry if that's not something you want to hear. Sorry if it goes counter to the liberal idealism and "common sense" you've been immersed in all your life. But, due to circumstances you can't perceive with the naked eye, you might not be able to "power through." The bargain of "work harder, achieve gains" is completely broken by chronic conditions that only become obvious once you notice that disconnect.

Internalize that, and do it quickly. Because COVID is rampant. If you personally are trying to get and stay fit, prevention is step 1. Our movement needs to reckon with that before we can even begin to think about how we build a fighting force.

We certainly have to stop trying to make judgements about the "fitness" of individual communists. How about you exercise a book or two and stop thinking like a liberal? I'm running on way too little sleep and way too much stress. If you're unsatisfied with these thoughts, DM me and maybe I'll have better thoughts when I'm not half-dead.
