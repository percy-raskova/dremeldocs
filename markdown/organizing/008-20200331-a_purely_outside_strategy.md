# a purely outside strategy

@aishaismad This primary has been a gut check to leftists everywhere that no matter how hard you fight from the outside to turn out disaffected voters, the establishment is so entrenched, and your message misses so many people, that a purely outside strategy is impossible. @aishaismad That she has been receiving praise from Democratic party insiders is proof that this strategy can work. Play their silly little games, gain power, do what you came here to do.

However, it needs to be paired with an independent, coordinated outsider effort. @aishaismad I still trust her to stay true to those policies and ideals she's been fighting for. But the strategy of an inside/outside game only works if everyone who gains power through surface-level gladhanding remembers where they came from, and fights to open up our electoral system.
