Ooh ouch owwww ow I burned myself on that hot take!!

Here, lemme heal myself with this burn ointment take: the victory of the working class does not require a single, solitary person who is aligned with the oppressors. Not a single one. We owe them absolutely nothing. https://t.co/5T6giYOVzU We don't even need to find common ground with "progressive" liberals.

Our ideological enemies completely understand that they are our enemies. Stop falling for the same traps over and over.
