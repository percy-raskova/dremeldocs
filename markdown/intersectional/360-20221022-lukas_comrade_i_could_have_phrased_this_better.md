# @lukas_comrade I could have phrased this better

@lukas_comrade I could have phrased this better. I don't see the *people* fighting within CPUSA as ideological enemies. The party itself has a revisionist line, and the leadership staunchly opposes correction. But unlike bourgeois institutions, there is a conceivable path to reform the party. @lukas_comrade It's the difference between a wild alligator and an abused dog that now attacks humans. You obviously cannot tame the gator. The dog is dangerous, but there's a possibility of resocializing it. I personally don't feel like it's worth it, but I don't fault someone else for trying.
