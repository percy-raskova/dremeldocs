# The funniest thing

The funniest thing about in-fighting on the left is that the fascists literally do not care, and are perfectly willing to murder anyone with ideologies from Lenin all the way down to JFK. Obviously it's important to know where you stand, and some people really have nothing to offer the movement. I'm just saying our existential enemies have much clearer priorities than us, and we need to be absolutely focused if we want to survive, let alone win.
