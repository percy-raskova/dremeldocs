# @Ya1hor Western "Marxists

@Ya1hor Western "Marxists" NEED to imagine this is correct, to avoid wrangling with the central role of imperialism in our comfort. A globe-spanning empire, centered around funneling extracted surplus toward the core, cementing the instinctive loyalty of the imperial working class. @Ya1hor Not only is imperialist oppression a much more rampant vector of hyper-exploitation than the "mundane" exploitation inherent to domestic capital, it's also the primary contradiction that must be undone to end capitalism. Anti-imperialism is not just moral: it's tactical.
