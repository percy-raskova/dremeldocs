# @NathanielNiznik @JoshNold_ @bobcat0803

@NathanielNiznik @JoshNold_ @bobcat0803 @marwilliamson I look forward to it! It's been inspiring to see how far he's gotten, how much he's done to shape the conversation in this country, and how much he's brought new people into the process.

Hopefully, he'll run for something else, and then pres again after Bernie's second term! @NathanielNiznik @JoshNold_ @bobcat0803 @marwilliamson I'm hoping this doesn't come across with the same condescension that the establishment served up to Bernie supporters in 2016. I legitimately think that Bernie and Yang are cut from the same "this whole system is not working" cloth, and I want to see more of Yang!
