# a political cartoon

In 10th grade, I drew a political cartoon for the school newspaper that caused the administration to make me apologize in front of the entire school.

Later, the principal sat me down to *privately* apologize for overreacting. https://t.co/ULPa7zXtX7 I didn't specify what the cartoon was, because it's shameful.

Every year, my ultra-Orthodox Jewish school would organize a propaganda trip to Israel to convince 11th graders to move there instead of going to college. That year, they decided they couldn't afford it anymore. So I drew a picture of a bridge between America and Israel -- a banner of which was a prominent fixture in this Zionist cult school -- but the bridge was broken, and people were falling off of it. They approved it because they thought it was a statement about "deteriorating conditions between America and Israel". I just wanted to go on vacation.

They kicked me off the paper, publicly shamed me, and also... I didn't even like Israel anymore by the time it was published.
