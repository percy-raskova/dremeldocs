Wanna see a thread full of people going "I'm disabled, but I viscerally despise people who are lazy/entitled/stupid/subhuman"? https://t.co/HB1MsFTiiO The pick-me's of this individualist, eugenicist, survival-of-the-fittest society. "Sure, I may be disabled, but I'm one of the GOOD disabled people. Not like those wretches who can't fend for themselves!"
