# The past few days

The past few days have been hilarious. A bunch of young people are unlearning their biases by actually engaging with Chinese people and culture, and then there's this corps of hardline propaganda enthusiasts "refuting" that exploration by reciting the equivalent of this video https://t.co/eD27tawhWl The instilled demonization and fear of China relies entirely on mystifying it as some inscrutable, alien entity, with no way to ever know what's real other than "official sources." Except there are MILLIONS of westerners actually paying attention now, and they like what they see. Exposure is the cure for bigotry -- whether it's the vitriolic bigotry of overt supremacy or the "soft" bigotry of "I just feel bad for them they have it so hard over there." And with the rapid familiarity people are finding, sinophobia becomes relegated to the domain of weirdos.
