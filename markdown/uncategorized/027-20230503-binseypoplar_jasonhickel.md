# @BinseyPoplar @jasonhickel

@BinseyPoplar @jasonhickel If action on the environment fails to draw in those who are ideologically opposed to saving the environment, that is a sign we are finally doing something substantial. Compromise between destruction and preservation is still destruction. @BinseyPoplar @jasonhickel This isn't high school debate. We're not trying to "win hearts and minds," we're trying to avert EXTINCTION. We don't need "participation" from those who have spent decades swindling, stealing, destroying, and preempting all progress: we need to beat them.
