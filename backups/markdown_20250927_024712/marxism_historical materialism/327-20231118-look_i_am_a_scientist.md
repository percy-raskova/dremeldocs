# Look, I am a scientist

Look, I am a scientist. I deal only in objective, material fact, and believe in nothing except that which is empirically provable.

But come ON. Can you think of a single thing more likely to create a vengeful spirit than HARVESTING THE SPERM OF THE VIOLENTLY DECEASED??? Any offspring created by such an act would obviously be a soulless abomination, cursed to wander the world in ardent hatred of all things good and pure.

In fact, I'd go so far as to say that a child like that might very well be the prophesied Herald of the Blood Dawn.
