# Last night, I had a dream that I came to be the caretaker...

Last night, I had a dream that I came to be the caretaker of a giant panda named "Worker," which I only knew because she told me so, psychically.

Everything else was, per my typical dream style, 100% realistic and mundane. Buying bamboo, giving Worker hugs, etc. At the time, I hadn't even thought twice about her being named Worker. It just made sense. What else would a panda be named, right?

Now I'm realizing it was a sign that my subconscious is preoccupied with the plight of the worker, endangered and forced from their natural homes.
