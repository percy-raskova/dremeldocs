# Make a ten

"Make a ten" means mentally moving the numbers around such that you are adding ten and some other number. In this case, 8 + 2 + 7 or 7 + 1 + 9.

It may seem like adding extra steps, but it's all about training your brain to actually understand the constituent parts of numbers. https://t.co/9VD1T0KKIt You *could* simply remember the phrase " 8 + 9 = 17". But that doesn't help you *understand* what that actually means. It's like teaching kids to read by showing them a series of common sentences and just saying "remember this." You need to know how the letters fit together. Math needs to *move*. The numbers need to feel flexible. To truly learn math is to understand a beautiful, natural logic. It has applications far beyond memorizing the basic fact that 8 + 9 = 17.
