# the 4.5 million Ukrainians

Believing this requires also believing that the 4.5 million Ukrainians who fought for the Soviets either:

1. Were too stupid to realize they were victims of genocide
2. Were too cowardly to resist conscription
3. Decided the ones who genocided them were STILL better than Nazis. https://t.co/dsoEU3XIo5 If I believed my government had, only a few years ago, deliberately murdered millions of my countrymen, there's not a chance in hell I'd side with them in ANY war. I certainly wouldn't think the genocidal *intent* of the Nazis was worse than the genocidal *actions* of the USSR. "Of course the decision was difficult! Even if people decided the Nazis were worse in a 25 to 1 ratio, that was only because they were all willing to fight to the death to prevent 5 million and ONE deaths. But not the 5 million deaths that Stalin had already deliberately done." Personally, I think the heroes who fought valiantly to save the world from the scourge of the Nazis were brave, principles, and knew exactly what they were doing.

But what do I know? I'm just a girl who hates fascism ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
