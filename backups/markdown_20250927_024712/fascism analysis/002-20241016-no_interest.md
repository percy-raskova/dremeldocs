# no interest

This is what I mean when I say Democrats will not save you, have no interest in protecting you, and are JUST as dangerous for queer people as Republicans are. We're already past the brief moment where they deem "trans rights" politically expedient. https://t.co/hER9XdxODC The only difference between "red states," where trans people are being actively persecuted, and "blue states," where we're tolerated, is that the latter group is biding their time. They're not a bulwark against fascism; they're just slow to triangulate. We are watching in real time as Democrats use "Trump helped trans people" as a gotcha, and people have the nerve to tell us that the gulf between them is wide enough to excuse genocide. It's not, and it wouldn't be even if they were the party of unlimited gender-affirming care. We're less than a decade from both parties being as identical on trans people as they are on "China-bad!" and "business-good!" and "COVID? Never heard of it!" and "drill baby drill!"

And of course, if it can last that long, the same unflinching support for Israel.
