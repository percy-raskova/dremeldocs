# After a month of medical leave , I finally returned to work...

After a month of medical leave, I finally returned to work yesterday, to find that a third of my department has been sick at once. And still no one has the thought "Hm, I wonder if we might be in the midst of a mass public health emergency." I just demonstrated quite visibly what the long term health impacts of covid are. A 29-year-old with no prior health conditions should not expect to lose a month of their life to severe pneumonia. A 29-year-old with long covid absolutely should expect it.
