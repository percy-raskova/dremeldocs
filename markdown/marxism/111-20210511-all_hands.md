# all hands

The PRO Act does some great stuff (overruling right-to-work laws, permitting secondary strikes, prohibiting union-busting "all hands" meeting and more), but one thing it does not do is prohibit no-strike clauses. I want to call on @SenSanders to put forward an amendment on this. No-strike clauses and no-strike laws essentially invalidate every other labor protection there is. When workers form a union, and the employer enters into negotiations, the workers may walk away with a contract that seems fair, but contains this poison pill. Employers have the power to hire whole teams of contract lawyers to ensure that whatever new mistreatment they intend to foist on the workers doesn't run afoul of the contract. And without the threat of a strike, the workers have no real leverage to bargain with. In Maryland, this type of worker repression is actually codified into law for many sectors, including teachers. And just like right-to-work, these laws prevent unions from being able to bring their full power to bear. No-strike clauses and no-strike laws must be overturned!
