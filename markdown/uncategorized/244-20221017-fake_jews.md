# fake Jews

@SherylWeikalLaw It is not hard to imagine official Israeli government policy (or just tacit state endorsement of vigilantes) targeting "fake Jews" who refuse to support apartheid. "Arab lovers" being assaulted, having their homes and businesses vandalized, getting taken in for questioning, etc. @SherylWeikalLaw Not to jump straight to Hitler, but, that's exactly how it progressed during the Third Reich. Average citizens who refused to participate in each escalating stage of genocide were deemed communist, Judeo-Bolshevik race traitors and oppressed alongside those they tried to protect.
