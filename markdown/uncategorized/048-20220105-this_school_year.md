# this school year

Doing this school year correctly from the start would have meant doubling staff, having half capacity in buildings, fully available virtual academies, installing commercial grade HEPA filters in every room, giving every adult and child 5 N95 masks, mandatory daily PCR testing... ... real contact tracing programs, monthly checks to keep everyone solvent in case they can't work, measures to trigger automatic shutdowns, guaranteed paid sick leave, quarantines with test-to-return, and of course mandatory vaccination.

It's actually pretty simple.
