# how easy liberals

@thrasherxy I'm loving how easy liberals are making the task of radicalizing people. They're not just staying rigidly locked where they were a decade or two ago: they're actively organizing *against* any hope of social progress and revealing themselves as the enemies they always were. @thrasherxy It's hard to understate the power of "Oh, you guys were right about this. I wonder what else you were right about ðŸ¤”"
