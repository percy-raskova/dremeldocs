# @ethan_k_eblg Yes, that is where the criticism comes from...

@ethan_k_eblg Yes, that is where the criticism comes from originally. My complaint is less about the phrase itself, and more about the dismissive attitude toward it. The whole problem with the phrase is that it doesn't accurately convey the concept we want to get across. @ethan_k_eblg But neither does vaguely gesturing at its inadequacies without actually specifying what they are. "Read the Gotha Critique" is even more vague and useless than "Labor creates all wealth." The job of Marxists is to educate, which requires more engagement than "No, you're wrong."
