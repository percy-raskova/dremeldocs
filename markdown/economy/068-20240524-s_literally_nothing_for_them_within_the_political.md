# s literally nothing for them within the political framework...

The most difficult thing to convey to young people who have come to political maturity in the last decade is that there's literally nothing for them within the political framework of liberalism, even the "progressive" wing, and it is good and necessary to move beyond it entirely. https://t.co/jhFx0d6fa5 Stop modulating to try and find an "acceptable" position. The political aims you instinctively seek cannot be found here, and they will never "compromise" with you -- only brush you aside. If they cannot subsume and diminish you politically, they move on to repression.
