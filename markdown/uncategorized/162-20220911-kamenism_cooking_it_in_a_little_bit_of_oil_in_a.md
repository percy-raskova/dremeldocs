@kamenism Cooking it in a little bit of oil in a pan is the best way to keep it from being slimy. Salt, pepper, garlic is a simple seasoning, but also things like Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and vinegar will boost savoriness. @kamenism Season *after* the initial cooking step! Salt draws moisture out of vegetables and essentially creates a barrier of steam that prevents browning. Same with the liquids I mentioned.
