# s like someone saying 

@FoxyMarxist It's like someone saying "George Jackson was not a theorist." The actual definition of "theorist" is irrelevant compared to the implications of dismissing Jackson's theoretical work. Any semantic discussion in that context is just an excuse to deny Jacksonian fascist theory. @FoxyMarxist Not that there aren't necessary updates to be made to that theory, which I do think is true. But dismissing him as a theorist -- whatever definition you're using to justify that dismissal -- is just shorthand for "I don't think the US is *that* bad. Which is just more chauvinism.
