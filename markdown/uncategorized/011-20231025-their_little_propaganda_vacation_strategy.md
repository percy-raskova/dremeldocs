# Their little propaganda vacation strategy

@transjewtalian Their little propaganda vacation strategy totally backfired on me, because at 15, I had literally never even realized the "settlements" in the west bank were anything more than just building houses on unclaimed land. Then they showed me. They BRAGGED about it. @transjewtalian Before then, it hadn't even occurred to me that there was anything to investigate at all. How can you learn and grow when you don't know there's something to learn? That's the exact purpose of the cult construct: to poison every potential source of information outside the cult.
