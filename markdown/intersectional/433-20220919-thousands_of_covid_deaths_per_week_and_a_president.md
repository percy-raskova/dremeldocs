# Thousands of COVID deaths per week and a president...

Thousands of COVID deaths per week and a president announcing the pandemic is over.

Fascists ramping up stochastic terrorism and "communists" saying MAGA is the future of organizing.

20 years to fully decarbonize and a law leasing 62 million acres per year to fossil fuel corps. If you're not an active, committed Marxist-Leninist yet, get on that right the fuck now.

I will help if you need it. I've done it for plenty of folks before.

We don't have time to waste.
