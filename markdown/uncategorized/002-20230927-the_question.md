# the question

@nardorum @5HAW4RMA This is begging the question. You are saying "Sex is defined as your ability to produce one of two gametes, because if you're one sex, you can't produce the gametes of the other sex." You could use the same argument to designate *any* trait as "immutable sex," like short vs. tall @nardorum @5HAW4RMA If you really want to define sex as "males produce sperm, females produce eggs," then that leads to some weird corollaries:

1. Half of all children have no sex at all.

2. Half of all people start off VERY female in the womb, then slowly lose femaleness throughout their lives. @nardorum @5HAW4RMA 3. A small percentage of people are sexless from birth, unable to produce any gametes at all.

4. A small percentage of people have 2 sexes, able to produce both types of gametes.

It's just such a bad definition overall.
