# some locally-sourced tomatoes

@bmcqd99 @m1vql1hdwt Conflating some locally-sourced tomatoes and sustenance is a mistake. How many calories of food per day can a community garden produce? People don't just need "wholesome" food, they need *enough* food to survive. @bmcqd99 @m1vql1hdwt The most productive community garden could potentially distribute a basket of nutritious veggies to everyone in the neighborhood once a week or every few days. They would still need to get the vast majority of their daily calorie intake from grocery stores. @bmcqd99 @m1vql1hdwt There *is* real value in being able to consistently provide people these services, if you can get to that level of productivity. But the value is not in being the providers of sustenance. And there is simply no way to feed entire urban populations without vast tracts of farmland.
