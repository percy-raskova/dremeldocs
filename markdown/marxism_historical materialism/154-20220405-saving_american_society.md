# Saving American society

Saving American society necessarily involves the @amazonlabor model of building militant unions from the ground up. It also involves rebuilding the militancy of existing unions. Most importantly, it involves *systematic* labor solidarity, not just tacit moral support. What I mean by systematic solidarity is unions explicitly having rules of engagement with other labor struggles. Standing committees tasked with cross-industry collaboration. Culture-building campaigns. Local councils. Secondary strikes, even when it's illegal.
