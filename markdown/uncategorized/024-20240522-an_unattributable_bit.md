# an unattributable bit

Same. When I see people using my ways verbatim (or nearly verbatim), my instinct isn't to angle for credit. It's to feel absolutely touched that people thought what I said was so poignant as to be an unattributable bit of universal wisdom. https://t.co/0dnt3Ty6H3 It's not plagiarism to repeat a particular phrasing, let alone an overall sentiment. We aren't here to win credit, we're here to build consciousness. The only "credit" that's ever necessary is to point people toward your sources of inspiration. I pair sharing my own thoughts with recommendations for further learning. I don't subordinate ideas to the "great men of history" who first taught me them. Communists have no prophets.
