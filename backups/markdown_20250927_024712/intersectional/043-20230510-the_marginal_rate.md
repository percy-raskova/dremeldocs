# the marginal rate

When the marginal rate of profit on an agricultural product falls below a certain threshold, it becomes unprofitable for the capitalist to continue to pay for the wages of the agricultural laborers, transportation, and other costs. The response is abrupt cessation of production. https://t.co/zLz8vBDpz1 Shackled by the regime of profit, food, that most basic human need, is literally left to wither on the vine. On the other side of the market construct, food is jealously guarded with all the force of the state. Profit is maintained by excluding those who can't afford to pay. All commodities follow this model: production and distribution follow the logic of profit, rather than need. Scarcity is invented, price is inflated, labor made subservient. Food, housing, medicine, energy, education are all commodified and squeezed through the valve of profit.
