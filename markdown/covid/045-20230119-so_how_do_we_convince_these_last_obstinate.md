# So, how do we convince these last obstinate holdouts that...

Conversation held at Davos:

Person 1: "So, how do we convince these last obstinate holdouts that the pandemic is over and it's time to get back to normal?"

Person 2: "Sorry, could you repeat that? This state-of-the-art HEPA filter is whirring right in my ear." Person 3: *coughs*

Two guards in hazmat suits: "Please come with us to your 14-day quarantine resort."
