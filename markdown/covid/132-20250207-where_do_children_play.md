# Where do children play

Where do children play? In the many public parks.

Chinese residential buildings are skyscrapers because it's more important for people to have a place to live than for some people to have a tiny, private fiefdom.

Here, 1.2 million children are homeless. Enjoy your fucking yard. https://t.co/dCyFc1ybBA Also China is MASSIVE and very diverse. Over a third of the population lives in rural areas. You don't want to live in a skyscraper? You've got options.
