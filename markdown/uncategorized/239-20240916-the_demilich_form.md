Another Win For Harris?

THE FELL CRYPT In a shocking turn of events, the demilich form of Ronald Reagan made one of its rare manifestations from out of its phylactery to announce its support for Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election. https://t.co/4rcwHTEi5G The hellish abomination -- an affront to nature and heaven alike -- made the decision to break its silence, ending its longstanding policy to "avoid wading into the putrescent stench of mortal affairs." When asked why it chose to endorse Harris, the fiscally conservative former president responded with "DEATH DEATH DEATH DEATH DEATH DEATH DEATH DEATH DEATH DEATH DEATH DEATH ALL THERE IS FOR US IS DEATH AND BARELY A SHADOW OF LIFE FOR THOSE WHO SHED THEIR SINEW AND VISCERA." At press time, the chittering skull, wreathed in green flame and animated solely by Reagan's malice and long-forsaken magicks had returned to the privacy of its eldritch pocket dimension, promising to return once more to herald the Dawn of the Day of Boundless Horror.
