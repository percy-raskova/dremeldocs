# @Innomen There are so many things to unpack in this one...

@Innomen There are so many things to unpack in this one tweet. I want to first of all say that none of what I'm saying is with vitriol, I'm just laying out some corrections:

First of all, mitochondria is not a parasite, it's an endosymbiont. It never had a parasitic relationship with us. @Innomen Second, replication leading to mutations that potentially have phenotypic effects is exactly how evolution works. Sometimes those effects are negligible, sometimes they're harmful, sometimes they're beneficial. @Innomen The idea that viruses automatically mutate to become less lethal and more transmissible is not the whole truth. Influenza viruses are a good example of low lethality viruses occasionally mutating to become more virulent AND more deadly, leading to outbreaks like the Spanish flu. @Innomen Just because something can become more deadly does not mean it will wipe out humanity. That's not what I was claiming. My point is that we can easily be dealing with cycles of highly deadly and virulent strains forever, which is not something we should just accept.
