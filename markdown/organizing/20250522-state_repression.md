# state repression

Look, I get the fear of state repression, but come on. You could just as easily have said "We had nothing to do with this, but we categorically do NOT condemn individuals who feel such righteous fury over the continued genocide of the Palestinian people." https://t.co/uM59ntIGOQ Simply having a rhetorically principled stance on Palestine *already* puts you in the crosshairs -- and that is absolutely a worthy cost. You wouldn't be weakening your position by refusing to condemn violence, you would be strengthening it. You *would* be weakening your position if you claimed credit for something you didn't do, both in terms of calling down repression you are unable to withstand and in terms of being unable to replicate and escalate the action. Both come down to a lack of organizational maturity. The problem with adventurism isn't the act itself, it's the inability of the movement to *use* the act to grow -- the blame for which lays at the feet of every conciliatory "radical" organization that has spent years avoiding the necessary development to direct the movement. The inability to even express support without claiming credit demonstrates a fundamental absence of a revolutionary orientation within the PSL. You cannot call yourself a revolutionary party if you condemn the very concept of revolutionary violence.
