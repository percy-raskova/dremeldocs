# a fundamental epistemological difference

This genre of "argument" is, again, indistinguishable from describing "evolutionists" as religious.

There is a fundamental epistemological difference between faith and empiricism. Beliefs built on the latter can always be recapitulated without transmission from "old believers." https://t.co/cbpplkX5eG As I've pointed out before, scientific socialism is constantly being "rediscovered" by those with the most to gain by adopting a revolutionary framework. They converge on of Marxism-Leninism, because it has been established as achieving desired results.

https://t.co/cquYCsOmsH Anyone can observe the social world around them, build an analytical framework, and use that understanding to change it. There's no faith involved. The results speak for themselves. You just don't like those results, and cry foul that they don't look like the utopia you envision.
