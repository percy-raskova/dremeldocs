# an evolutionary biologist

You are an evolutionary biologist in January 2020. A novel coronavirus has been revealed as the culprit of an outbreak of pneumonia cases.

The WHO has asked for your perspective. Which of the following do you tell them confers a selective advantage for viruses? Based on your above assessment, what do you tell them is the best course of action to prevent mass death and disability from this new pathogen? Trick question! As an expert in evolution, the WHO has no use for your perspective. They have opted to handle the incoming pandemic with a vibes-based approach. Good luck!
