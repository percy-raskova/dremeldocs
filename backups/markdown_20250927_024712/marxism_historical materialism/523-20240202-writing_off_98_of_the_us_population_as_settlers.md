# Writing off 98% of the US population as settlers

@DecolonialMarx "Writing off 98% of the US population as settlers" is such a telling statement. Regardless of the actual numbers, "settler" is an acknowledgement of a material relation between classes of people. Decolonization entails the abrogation of the entire settler construct, not PEOPLE. @DecolonialMarx Victory will be when there are no more settlers. Believing that means you personally will be murdered or forcibly expelled says more about which side of the conflict you identify with, which side you will fight for, and therefore which hill you will (maybe literally) die on.
