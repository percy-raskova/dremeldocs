# definitely voting for

If you look at the percentages of people who are "definitely voting for" their candidate of choice, the numbers show a close, two-way race:

Biden: 18.2%
Sanders: 17.8%
Warren: 3.6%
Buttegieg: 2.4%
Yang: 2%

56% of primary voters are still in play. (Taken from Emerson polling data, December 18, 2019.

I just multiplied the candidates' national support by the percentage of those supporters who said they would definitely vote for that candidate.

Biden polls at 32%, but only 57% are locked in, which is 18.2% overall.)
