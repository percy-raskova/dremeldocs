"(Because of the sensitivity of the material, access to the archive will be determined on the basis of strict criteria.)"

lmao "Thus far, the commission has not taken testimony directly, but it will begin to do so soon."

What happened to "testimony after testimony"??? "She described a number of videos that Hamas distributed in which naked women are seen, with signs on them that leave little room for doubt."

This is an article describing a commission describing a person describing videos depicting rape. Hearsay^4 ðŸ™ƒ Also "Hamas distributed" to whom, exactly?? I've been following everything the resistance has put out: not one mention of any of this. She describes cheering crowds and open calls for assault, trying to paint them as savages filled with pride -- but they haven't bragged at all. This article drag on and on, recounting endless storytelling about the existence of rampant evidence that surely must exist out there somewhere -- and not even a single "This happened to me." They call it "systematic," and we have yet to see a SINGLE victim come forward. They wail about how no one believes the victims, without presenting ANY VICTIMS AT ALL. It's astounding how long the article goes on without saying anything. It talks about NGOs and the failure of the UN and the crack team of investigators assigned to the case. No victims though.
