# government collapse

Americans have the wrong association with the phrase "government collapse." It's not like the country descended into civil war and rebels seized the capitol. It's the Euro equivalent of a US "government shutdown." The same people are in charge, they just aren't doing their job. All that needs to happen is for the president to select a new prime minister or call for a new election. This is just the way they do things in Europe. The king is dead, long live the king.
