# the only real contamination source

@swoletariat69 @mageta649 DO NOT!

Medium rare is a thing for beef because the only real contamination source comes from *outside* the muscle (i.e. E. coli in the gut). This is NOT the case with birds!! Salmonella and clostridium live *inside* the meat! @swoletariat69 @mageta649 Also, ground beef should be cooked through, since... the outside is now mixed up with the inside.

As always, these are just risk statements. It's totally possible to have raw chicken that is free of pathogens, and there is always a tiny chance of tainted non-well-done beef.
