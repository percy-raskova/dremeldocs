# lesser of two evils

From the constitution of the CPUSA, Article VIII, Section 2.

The discourse around whether or not communists should vote for the "lesser of two evils" belies the attitude of the communist party toward the existing empire. The party explicitly prohibits ending the bourgeois state. https://t.co/OIYGtl9liA Article III, Section 8:

"All members who are eligible shall register and vote in all public elections, wherever possible."

It's not just a question of "keeping out fascists." Participation in bourgeois democracy is literally party-mandated, no matter who the candidates are. I'm not saying the CPUSA is irreparably compromised. I'm not saying it's "full of feds." The constitution has plenty of room within it for changing priorities and strategies. But in its current form, it is NOT a revolutionary organization. It prohibits revolution.
