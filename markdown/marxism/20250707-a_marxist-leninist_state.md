# a Marxist-Leninist state

Anyway, let's do some reading on how a Marxist-Leninist state used a combination of deep democratic engagement and levelheaded leadership to overcome centuries of parriarchy and implement the most liberatory, feminist, pro-queer law code in human history.

https://t.co/5j1HBebAWf https://t.co/qiuu8ikPZB If you don't get why so many trans people are Marxist-Leninists, you clearly don't know enough trans people. Somewhere around 50% of the Marxists I know are trans, and somewhere around 90% of trans people I know are either MLs themselves or sympathetic to the cause. "Why would [X oppressed group] be Marxists?"

Maybe those oppressed people... AREN'T gullible saps. Maybe we're taking our destiny into our own hands, fighting for our liberation with clear eyes and fiery hearts. Maybe we have agency, and know what we're doing.
