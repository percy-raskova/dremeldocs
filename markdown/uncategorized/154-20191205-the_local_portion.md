# the local portion

@OSilvermanA My thinking is essentially that we need a HUGE influx of cash immediately to not only fund the local portion of Kirwan recommendations, but to go beyond that and address the Baltimore-specific issues that can't be papered over with just throwing money at the problem. @OSilvermanA Preparing ourselves through deficit spending would get us over the hump without needing to make "unpopular" choices, so we can fund necessary projects. In the hands of an increasingly progressive city council and mayor (which we should be simultaneously fighting for)... @OSilvermanA ... that deficit can be pointed to as a reason why we NEED to stop over-funding police and under-taxing corporations. This deficit spending should be presented as us prioritizing education so much that we're willing to pay *anything* for it. Then, we can cut out waste elsewhere.
