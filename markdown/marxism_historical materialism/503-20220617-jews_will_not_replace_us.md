# Jews will not replace us

@BlackRedGuard1 European Jews were ardent socialists since even before Marx, and now we have American Jews voting for people aligned with the fascists who literally chant "Jews will not replace us!" and plant hundred-page manifestos describing Jews as demons. @BlackRedGuard1 When you ask them why, they say "They're good on Israel," i.e. "It's our turn to be the fascists!"
