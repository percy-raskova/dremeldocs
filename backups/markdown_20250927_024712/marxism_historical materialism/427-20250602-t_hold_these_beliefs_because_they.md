# t hold these beliefs because they

1. They don't hold these beliefs because they're "comically evil" *OR* because they were strapped into a mind control device. It's because they have a material interest in believing that propaganda.

2. I don't care why they believe it. As long as they do, they are an enemy. https://t.co/aowd3CTCcT Liberals love to quibble over whether or not Hitler was Like That because his soul was impure, or if he was just lied to about Jews too much.

I don't give a shit. Kill Hitler.
