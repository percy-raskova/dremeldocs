# a purified version

@Rocko64_ To be fair, taking a pill with a purified version of a micronutrient is generally subject to MUCH less efficient uptake compared to that same nutrient in food. So something that says "320% daily value" might really only end up being equivalent to 80% if it was coming from food. @Rocko64_ Still, the entire supplement industry is deeply under regulated, makes health claims without any scientific backing, and is largely just snake oil -- including FISH oil supplements ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
