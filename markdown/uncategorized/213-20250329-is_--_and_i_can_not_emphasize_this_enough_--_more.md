# is -- and I can not emphasize this enough -- more insipid...

This is -- and I cannot emphasize this enough -- more insipid and uninspired than most of the AI art I've seen. https://t.co/cHbVwTUCaJ Like, this is actually emotionally resonant to me. I strongly connect with the theme here in a way that makes "this seems backwards" feel utterly puerile in comparison.

https://t.co/tu7TBItmhC Just the same overwrought "Technology is Making Us Less Human" drivel I've seen over and over my entire life. Not even an especially artful rendition; just a person literally spelling out "this seems backwards."

"I'm 14 and this is deep" level stuff. https://t.co/6V7AsuswJl
