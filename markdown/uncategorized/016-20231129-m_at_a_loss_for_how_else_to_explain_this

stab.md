# m at a loss for how else to explain this:

*stab stab stab...

I'm at a loss for how else to explain this:

*stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab stab*

*bandage*

"There, not only has the stabbing stopped, I even gave you a bandage! Why aren't you more grateful??" "Also, technically the stabbings weren't my fault. Stabbings are just a part of life. What do you want me to do, prevent them?? The stabbers are vital to our flourishing society, I can't piss them off. Plus, the other guy wouldn't even give you a bandage-- where are you going???"
