# the Jewish Zionists

When I say that I feel more kinship with the Palestinian resistance than with the Jewish Zionists, I mean *literal* kinship. I feel no familial love for oppressors, only for liberators. The blood of revolution is thicker than the water of the womb. My cousins are being bombed, starved, and blamed for their own oppression. I shed tears for their loss, and my heart burns with pride at their resistance. With every day that passes, I feel more called to do whatever it takes to aid in their struggle.
