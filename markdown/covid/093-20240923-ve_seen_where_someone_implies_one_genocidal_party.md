# ve seen where someone implies one genocidal party is better...

This is the third post I've seen where someone implies one genocidal party is better than the other, because Republicans are opposed to... drag?

They can't even muster the courage to say the word "trans." It's all about a relatively inoffensive, accessible performance style. https://t.co/6R8XeFETTF Wonder if that has to do with Democrats presiding over 4 years of expansion of anti-trans genocidal propaganda, organizing, and policy, and doing nothing but say "We don't like this, but what can we do? üôÅ"

Almost as if neither party has anything to offer *any* oppressed group. If Kamala wins, the oppression of trans people will continue to get worse. The oppression of black people, indigenous people, immigrants, disabled people, and women will continue to get worse. If Israel manages to hang on for that long, the genocide will continue to get worse. The climate crisis will continue to get worse, even amid "historic" policies, such as tax cuts for luxury condos that have solar panels.

And at the end of that term, we'll see these same ghouls say "Well, the Republicans will make things worse! Do you want things to get worse??"
