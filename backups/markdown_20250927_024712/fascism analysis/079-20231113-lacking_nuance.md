# "lacking" nuance

There are a lot of people decrying this analysis as "lacking" nuance. Yes, duh. It's a Twitter thread. And one that was written *while* I was actively trying to make observations. There is a ton of nuance that necessarily gets flattened out from that. https://t.co/Flp90vNVep Any analysis from the outside is necessarily going to ignore internal debate, reconciliation, ideological depth of individual members and subfactions, etc. Especially because MUG is very clearly still trying to find itself, any analysis is likely to become obsolete quickly. Which was kind of the entire point. I wasn't issuing praise or denunciation, and I certainly wasn't writing some grand treatise -- such a thing would be laughable at this stage of MUG's development. I was more thinking out loud, to assess for myself whether I would want to join.
