# a very valid perspective

@Galaxycathere This is a very valid perspective to have on the label "communist."

For me, I don't presume to know everything about Marxism, and I'm learning more every day. But I still call myself "communist" because I understand *enough* to be principled in my pursuit of communism. @Galaxycathere I definitely agree that many in the west call themselves communist without having done any self-examination or purging individualism from their hearts. Or having any intention of actually building a communist society. Or even having a solid base of Marxist theory. It's reckless.
