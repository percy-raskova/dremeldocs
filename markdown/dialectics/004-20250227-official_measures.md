# official measures

@rednewafrikan Just going by "official measures," there genuinely are significantly fewer transmascs than transfems. That seems to indicate either that there is less willingness to come out (and/or more ability to stay hidden) or less *need* to identify that way. @rednewafrikan That is, due to the distinct nature of the way masculinity and femininity are treated, a certain amount of divergence from Archetypal Femininity can be tolerated -- in the dialectical interplay of self-conception and social treatment -- without necessitating "going full trans." @rednewafrikan As opposed to divergence from Archetypal Masculinity, which has a lower threshold for getting you shunted into the realm of ostracism. E.g. someone ascribed Woman can dress "mannish" with a LOT less social and self dissonance than someone ascribed Man.
