# s blindness, try looking up Cuba

If you enjoyed that YouTube person paying to cure 1,000 people's blindness, try looking up Cuba's Operación Milagro, which has done the same for MILLIONS of people across dozens of countries. Venezuela has also been instrumental in Operación Milagro, of course, and I shouldn't erase their contribution.
