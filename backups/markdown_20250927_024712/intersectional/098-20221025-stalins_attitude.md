# Stalin's attitude

@SherylWeikalLaw There is absolutely no excuse for Stalin's attitude and actions toward queer people. Castro was able to evolve past the idea of "bourgeoise decadence," legalizing same-sex relations (after too many years of carrying forward Batista's persecution), and admitting personal fault. @SherylWeikalLaw As far as antisemitisim, Stalin clearly started out as a staunch opponent of anti-semitism, calling it "the most dangerous vestige of cannibalism" and promising the death penalty to any antisemite.

He was, however, deeply repressive of *religion*--Judaism, Christianity, etc. @SherylWeikalLaw A lot of the conversation around Soviet Jews revolves around the various measures taken by the USSR to try to forcibly "evolve" religious people. These actions were not just oppressive, but counter-productive, allowing reactionaries to latch onto faith as a tool of recruitment. @SherylWeikalLaw Again, no excuse to be made for this. But there is a clear difference between "antisemitism," i.e. racial animus towards people of Jewish heritage, and religious persecution.
