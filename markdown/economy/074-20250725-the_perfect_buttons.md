# the perfect buttons

I always fall for this bait because it pushes the perfect buttons for me. It simultaneously undermines the craft of economical, delicious home cooking (the status quo for all human history) AND places people who habitually spend these ridiculous amounts on takeout as the victims. https://t.co/GL71qjUTTP It's the biggest slap in the face to those who struggle with actual food insecurity. People who aren't even CLOSE to making the decision between spending $60 on a restaurant trip and spending $60 on ingredients and then discarding $50 worth of it. I want to be clear that my family growing up was NOT food insecure. Not like my neighbors then or now. We always had food on the table, because at any point, one or both of my parents was always employed. But there was no way we were EVER going to be casually eating out. We didn't order food and then complain that it was expensive. We bought REAL food -- sensible ingredients that we could afford -- prepared it thriftily, and prioritized finishing leftovers before getting more food. If you have the money for restaurants, you can do that easily. My parents both cooked, because it would have been ridiculous for my mom (the better cook) to do it every day. As soon as my siblings and I were old enough, we shopped, cooked, and cleaned as well. We were taught the value of not wasting money, food, or time. I can barely even imagine how all this looks to people for whom just getting ANY food is an uncertainty. That's over 15% of the US population. Worldwide, it's over 30%. "Groceries are more expensive than restaurants" is the most ridiculous, entitled, out of touch, 10%er bullshit.
