# @swoletariat69 My point was that the conflict itself isn't...

@primarycatdad @swoletariat69 My point was that the conflict itself isn't "the point," it's the means. Which is an important distinction to make for weeding out people who aren't actually interested in *building* anything, and just want to smash stuff. @primarycatdad @swoletariat69 And "heightening the struggle" is not simply "making things worse for people." It's trying to help people (and explaining why), having that help be blocked by the state (and explaining why), violently resisting violence (and explaining why), and leveraging the mass support @primarycatdad @swoletariat69 you build through that process toward greater and greater mobilization. A feedback loop that culminates in a fully-mobilized working class, which is the ONLY way to seize power from the already-mobilized bourgeoisie. @primarycatdad @swoletariat69 Adventurism is skipping all the boring stuff and just trying to mobilize militarily. And then being confused that "the masses" aren't taking up arms and joining you in Glorious People's War, and in fact are angry at YOU, instead of the repressive forces. Because hegemony.
