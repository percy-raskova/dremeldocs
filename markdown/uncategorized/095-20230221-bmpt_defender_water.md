# @BMPT_Defender Water

@BMPT_Defender Water is more efficient at HIGH temperatures, like the ones generated by conventional fuel. But what this actually means is that we're using a TON of energy to accomplish the same result we could get with more vaporizable substances at lower heat. @BMPT_Defender For example, we already use setups that concentrate solar energy to heat water for steam turbines: it seems like we could do this much more efficiently using low boiling point refrigerants, which I can't find evidence of us doing. @BMPT_Defender With enough refrigerant, it could even solve the issue of energy storage: at peak sunlight/wind/etc. output, use excess energy to power compressors for massive vats of refrigerants. When you need energy, release it and allow it to vaporize and turn a turbine.
