# @HellcatFellOff In Judaism, not really

@HellcatFellOff In Judaism, not really. The Qur'an is some 77,000 words long, while the Talmud Bavli is estimated to be nearly 2 million words long üòµ‚Äçüí´

The Tanakh (Torah, Nevi'im, and K'tuvim) might be a closer comparison, at about 80,000 words, but that's only considered half of the picture. @HellcatFellOff The tradition goes that there was always meant to be a "written Torah" (i.e. the Tanakh) and an "oral Torah" (i.e. the Mishnah, which forms the basis of the Talmud). It would have been weird for people to memorize the written section, and unthinkable to NOT memorize the oral one. @HellcatFellOff But of course, the oral tradition eventually was written down, because people were forgetting it lol. That became the Mishnah. Over the generations, as prominent rabbis debated endlessly over it, their discussions became codified into the behemoth text that is the Talmud. @HellcatFellOff Later, even MORE commentary was appended onto the already codified Talmud, as well as the Tanakh. These commentaries are more considered supplementary for study purposes, not really "scriptural."

And then there are Midrash and Aggadah, which are still very much oral traditions.
