# not even a communist perspective

It is mind-boggling from not even a communist perspective, but just a normal, rational view. Even just 15 years ago, parents would have been over the moon, bragging to their friends about how "My kid is learning CHINESE and making friends from another country, ALL ON THEIR OWN!!" https://t.co/rfI2FjBXFh All but the most hardcore racists would have been amazed that their kids were, of their own volition, "expanding their horizons" and "learning new skills."

Now suddenly, they're freaking out that the kids are "radicalizing" and "becoming Chinese," and how "this is the end." Lots of Americans schools used to match students with pen pals from another country *specifically* for this purpose. I'm sure some of these "concerned parents" had Chinese pen pals themselves.

I'm not saying I don't *get* what changed. It's just horrifying how easy it was.
