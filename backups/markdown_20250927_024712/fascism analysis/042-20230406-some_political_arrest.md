# some political arrest

Couple of things to note:

1) This was not some political arrest. It was a protest by Florida Dems deliberately planned *for the purpose* of getting arrested, as a photo op. They were released immediately.

2) The shirt is not "ironic," it was specifically chosen. https://t.co/nsDTKW7NNn In fact, Nikki Fried later tweeted where you can buy the shirt yourself.

3) The purpose of the stunt was explicitly to drum up donations from exactly the kind of people who love the sentiment of "Just Fucking Vote". And it worked.

https://t.co/4zudo0hh0O 4) Just like pointing out the "hypocrisy" of right-fascists does nothing to stop them, pointing out the absurdity of a "Just Vote" shirt being worn by a supposed target of said fascism doesn't actually change the state of play. Poke your fun, of course. Their little games are objectively silly. But it's not like this is an example of liberals "getting what's coming to them" anymore than it's a "heroic stand against repression." For now, they're all in the same club. They'll get what's coming later.
