# @kevinredifer @oikeios @atomicapproach

@kevinredifer @oikeios @atomicapproach @BizarrelyCoca Setting aside the absurdity of conflating the USSR with modern Russia, the entire reason the U.S. has worked to isolate capitalist Russia is *because* of its control of massive fossil fuel reserves. Russia was not content to just become another U.S. energy colony. @kevinredifer @oikeios @atomicapproach @BizarrelyCoca Instead, it has positioned itself as an opposing capitalist pole, which the U.S. can't abide. It needs absolute hegemony. While it's obviously ludicrous to valorize capitalist Russia as some bastion of global integrity, its fossil fuels would fare no better in U.S. hands.
