# @Uriel_Ramir3z I definitely think this practice ought to...

@Uriel_Ramir3z I definitely think this practice ought to change. For one thing, not all patients have family, not all patients have *reliable* family, and not all family members will be able to adequately convey the medical reality to patients. @Uriel_Ramir3z Everyone has a right to health -- something Cuba understands and strives for above all others. But sometimes that becomes impossible, and so patients also have a right to know *why* their right to health cannot be met.
