# @RickdaBuffalo @w0kesolanas

@kobasuperfan @RickdaBuffalo @w0kesolanas @CommieChip Yeah, that's true. I don't "criticize" people I know don't actually share my goals at all. I criticize anarchists, I criticize trotskyists, I criticize my fellow Marxist-Leninists, I criticize vague, undifferentiated radicals, etc. I don't criticize liberals -- I repudiate them. @kobasuperfan @RickdaBuffalo @w0kesolanas @CommieChip And I CERTAINLY don't criticize fascists like Hinkle and the ilk. They are firmly in the enemy camp.
