# the antigen tests

@bidetmarxman Yes, the antigen tests are hilariously bad, and a negative result on them is considered inconclusive, even per the ridiculously lax guidance from the CDC. Their only relevance is that a positive antigen tests means you are *definitely* still positive. @bidetmarxman And they are theoretically designed to detect a broad spectrum of variants: most of them target the virus's nucleocapsid protein, which does evolve less slowly than, say, the spike protein. But it DOES evolve, and I don't have any clue how frequently companies revalidate the test
