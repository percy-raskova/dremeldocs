# Communist Party of North America

@probablykaffe This is why I always conceive of the vanguard that will need to be built as necessarily being something more like "Communist Party of North America." Any org defining themselves as "of America," as in the US is being obtuse and nationally-chauvinistic. @probablykaffe Sure, a party claiming an entire continent as its domain could be said to be too broad, incapable of representing the will of the myriad different populations in that space. But that's the point -- how can you call yourself a vanguard if you DON'T represent ALL oppressed peoples? @probablykaffe The calculus for being able to call yourself "THE Communist Party" would be deep connections in communities across North America, building readiness for a full-scale revolution. Even if you're MORE rooted in some places, liberatory horizons need to be as broad as imperial ones.
