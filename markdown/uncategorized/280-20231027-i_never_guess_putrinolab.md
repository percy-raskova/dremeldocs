# @I_never_guess @PutrinoLab

@I_never_guess @PutrinoLab I do think it can be helpful to learn tools to not spiral into catatonic despair over circumstances beyond our control. But the goal *here* is to avoid putting those circumstances *into* our control, with research and preventative measures -- like not getting infected! @I_never_guess @PutrinoLab It's an ideological project, and it permeates every aspect of our society's disastrous approach to medicine (and every social problem): individualize and downplay the symptoms, not the cause. Because addressing the *real* cause would require immense upheaval.
