# poor health

@jubunnies I feel this way all the time, and then I feel guilty for feeling this way, because it feels adjacent to the sentiment of people who blame people for "poor health," because they didn't exercise enough or eat well or abstain from drugs, etc.

And then I remember that... @jubunnies ... the people I feel enraged at for complaining about contracting this eminently preventable disease are often THE SAME PEOPLE denigrating others for "poor decisions." The health supremacists are the ones making themselves sicker and sicker: they think it can't happen to them.
