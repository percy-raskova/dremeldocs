# 'm saying they should be illegal 

I'm saying they should be illegal.

So should every "treatment" that doesn't have any proven medical benefits. And especially those like chiropractic that are proven to actually *cause* harm. https://t.co/VqZ0JOCveA It's pretty simple: if it works, it is pretty easy to prove it works. If you can't prove it, it doesn't work.

If it hasn't been proven *yet*, it theoretically might work... so just prove it! Then you get to call it real!
