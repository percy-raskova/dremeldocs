# do n't expect perfection from anyone ( certainly not myself...

I don't expect perfection from anyone (certainly not myself)! But I do have some litmus tests for how trustworthy someone is:

- Bigotry is utterly disqualifying
- Support for Cuba is a layup at this point
- Taking COVID seriously (at least after being properly informed) - Labor solidarity. Non-negotiable.
- Solidarity with indigenous, disabled, homeless, elderly, and other populations capitalism tries to disappear
- Acknowledging the existential threat of climate crisis.
- Respect for the scientific process (without succumbing to "sciencism") There are others, and it's definitely a heuristic, not an algorithmic checklist. I can generally tell through interacting with an individual how capable of growth they are.

These measures are more appropriately applied to organizations, movements, and subclasses. No one person is set in stone. People change. Sometimes they get worse: hegemony is powerful, class interests dominate, etc.

Sometimes they're open to being educated, but mostly, their growth is dictated by circumstances beyond our immediate control.
