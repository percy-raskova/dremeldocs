# @predederva @cowboypussykit

@predederva @cowboypussykit A protein that triggers signalling cascades that do different things in different cells, yeah. Which is why people can have the SRY gene but not develop as a male if they have androgen insensitivity, can have the gene without the y chromosome due to transposition errors, etc. @predederva @cowboypussykit "IT'S BASIC BIOLOGY" say people who stopped learning biology after 8th grade. ðŸ¤·
