# these 'convenience' apps

All of these "convenience" apps are middlemen, specifically created for capital to wriggle its way into smaller gaps. As the rate of profit continues to fall, capitalists constantly need to "innovate" new methods of exploitation. https://t.co/iTPKhyEtBX The rate of profit in these "industry disrupting" ventures starts off already low, funded by enticing investors with promises that it will rise someday. But the only way for the rate of profit to rise is to increase exploitation on an already overexploited workforce. It all comes to a head when the ventures are revealed to not just be underperforming because they're "still growing," but because they are fundamentally unprofitable. Investors pull out, funding dries up, the company tries to raise profit with wildly-inflated prices... and dies.
