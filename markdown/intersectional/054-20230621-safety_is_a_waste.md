# Safety is a waste

A billionaire who once said "Safety is a waste" -- a sentiment propagated as a fundamental tenet of capitalism -- has become the victim of his own ideological myopia. He has been crushed in a watery tomb of his own design, in a perfect rendition of the classic Grecian tragedies. No, he did not deserve this fate. He deserved to be chained to a factory floor, his hands outstretched to be crushed in the remorseless gears of unsecured industrial machinery, only to recover and be crushed anew in an endless, Promethean torment.

Do not ask me to shed a tear.
