# @NateB_Panic Same reason

@NateB_Panic Same reason we don't have a unified movement in the first place: lack of scientific and political development. If they're not COVID conscious, then they're neither radical nor scientifically literate. They're guided more by prevailing narratives than by earnest analysis. @NateB_Panic There's no barrier to entry to calling yourself "on the left." No significant social drawback, no expectation of labor, no responsibility to a collective. It's easy to put on a "progressive" mask, and then take it off again when it becomes inconvenient.
