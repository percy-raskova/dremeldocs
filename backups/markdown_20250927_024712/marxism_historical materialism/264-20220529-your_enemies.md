# your enemies

If you're looking for a model of anti-capitalism that can actually win, study 20th century history and look for what capitalists were most terrified of.

If you want to know who your enemies are, look at who capitalists have supported.

It's really not that complicated. Similarly, if you want to know which leftist models are *not* useful, look at which movements the capitalists didn't see as a threat.
