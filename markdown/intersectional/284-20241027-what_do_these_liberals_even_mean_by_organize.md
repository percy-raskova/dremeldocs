# What do these liberals even mean by "organize"

What do these liberals even mean by "organize"? What "organizing" are you doing that is currently condoned by Democrats and will get you shot on sight under Trump? What "organizations" are you building? What relevance does your "organizing" have to anything? They're honestly just writing fanfiction about a young adult dystopia novel, where doorknocking to elect "progressive Democrats" gets you hunted down by blackshirts.

I promise you, everything real is already either explicitly illegal, or subject to extrajudicial persecution. Even the most "radical" actions you can conceive of, like "campus encampments" or "forest defenders" get met with brutal, often bloody repression, by Democrats and Republicans alike -- and these actions *still* aren't even close to affecting change. There is simply no possible way to tactically maneuver the landscape of the bourgeois regime to make it more amenable to the kind of organizing that matters. No matter who is in power, no matter how carefully you toe the line of rules-as-written, the hammer will fall on you. You can meticulously craft an organization that operates wholly within the boundaries of the law every step of the way, and operates solely under the governance of the most progressive Democrats, and *still* find yourself getting torn apart if you're doing something that matters. If there is even a slight chance that your organization could feasibly liberate people, meeting your entire community's material and educational needs, developing them politically and forging the bedrock of revolution, you will face every counter-insurgency tactic in the book. Everything from lawfare to embargo to blacklisting to infiltration to media blitzes to trumped-up charges to "accidental" police brutality is in the cards, no matter who deals out the hand. You cannot affect the outcome as long as you stay in the game. The key is not to avoid doing anything that could bring that repression down on your heads. Surrendering before you've even fought is the same as being defeated. Instead, your "organizing" needs to take the form of training and planning to *win* in the face of that repression. Acting like any particular vote is a tactical maneuver to mitigate and delay the repression both ignores the active repression happening *right now*, and trains you to evade, rather than to win. Your instinct is to fold on every hand, hoping you'll eventually get lucky. You won't get lucky. You've never gotten lucky. The game is rigged. The only option is to stop playing, and organize something new.

If you can't see that now, when the choice is between Genocide Plus™️ and Genocide Premium™️, I don't know how to convince you.
