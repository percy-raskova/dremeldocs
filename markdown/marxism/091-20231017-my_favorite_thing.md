# My favorite thing

My favorite thing is how liberals always make sure to clarify in the simplest possible terms where the battle lines are drawn. They intuitively understand who is an ally of western capitalist hegemony and who is not -- much more intimately than so-called "leftists." https://t.co/KQ6BDtFDPs You would do well to pay attention to who the liberals decry and who they praise -- and why. Which side applauds literal Nazis and which side violently resists apartheid and genocide. I am begging those of you who *want* to stand on the side of liberation to figure it out. Obviously I'm not suggesting that uncritically opposing whatever liberals support and vice versa is in any sense a substitute for actual analysis. I'm simply saying that you *begin* your investigation by realizing that every liberal cry for "justice" is made cynically.
