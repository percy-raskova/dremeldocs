@RedAndreou @sovietstern That's because, like all fascists, their ideology rests on the notion that the current social order is already built on fundamentally noble and pure principles, and any problems are the result of meddling by a subversive, alien entity (Jews, Chinese, "the woke," pick your poison) @RedAndreou @sovietstern The only difference between these scum and the supremacist-and-proud types is that their chosen audience is people already primed to believe in a vague "socialism good," without knowing anything about what that means. So their "fundamentally pure society" gets called socialist.
