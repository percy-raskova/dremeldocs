# unrestricted submarine warfare

@linuslast They were thinking that they needed to return to unrestricted submarine warfare to choke off the western front, which would definitely provoke the U.S. into war anyway. Mexican invasion might have forestalled that for long enough for Germany to win and then come help Mexico. @linuslast And of course it was a stupid plan! That's why Mexico didn't go for it. No one is eager to accept a role on distraction duty, in the vague hope of being bailed out at some indeterminate future date. And Germany could not have just mopped up the allies that quickly.
