# spent years diligently avoiding COVID , and it still wormed...

I spent years diligently avoiding COVID, and it still wormed its way in. Because I have a housemate who, just like everyone else, doesn't give a shit. Yesterday was the sickest I've ever felt, including my first infection. Today is still awful, but better. I haven't asked her how she's doing. I never really talk to her anyway, and honestly, I have zero empathy for her. I can't care anymore. Sorry if that makes me a horrible person or a bad communist, but I can't give a shit. If you don't care about COVID, I don't care about you.
