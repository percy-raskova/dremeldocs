# a city council hearing

As a city council hearing about preparing for #kirwan. Apparently, Baltimore is trying to prep by modestly tweaking budgets of other departments, rather than radically shifting our budgeting priorities. The finance department asked each department to make lists of their budgetary priorities, and note the 5% lowest priority projects. This would wreak havoc on the bare-bones Rec and Parks budget, for a gain of ~$3 million, and allow BPD to remain bloated. None of it comes close to the amount we need according to the Kirwan formula. They keep saying we can't cut more (the police budget absolutely could be cut more than 5%), and we can't raise taxes, because we already have a high tax burden (unless you're a giant corporation). The solution is simple. We need to accept spending on deficit. Borrow $100 million/year while our students make their way through the school system, incentivize them staying here, then slowly phase in higher income taxes to pay off that debt. We'd have a new crop of educated, productive young people paying into the system. Crimes of desperation would fall sharply--once we stop leaving people behind--so we could further ramp down the police.
