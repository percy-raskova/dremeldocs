# @YetChannel @ByYourLogic

@YetChannel @ByYourLogic The wild plant is edible, it's just not as tasty as any of the cultivars.

Brassica is a genus that includes this species, as well as several others like B. nigra, B. juncea, and B. hirta, all of which give us varieties of mustard seeds. @YetChannel @ByYourLogic The classic bitter taste of mustard seed, cruciferous veggies, and horseradish comes from compounds that all Brassicaceae plants produce: glucosinolates.
