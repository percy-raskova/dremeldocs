Jimmy Dore, champion of the dumbdumb left, is citing a study that he says shows that people with PhDs are more likely to be vaccine hesitant as "proof" that smarter people avoid the vaccine.

He clearly did not even skim the study and its methods. The study in question asked people if they got the vaccine, and if not, how likely they were to get it. It asked them over the course of 5 months to see how attitudes changed.

Among the people with PhDs, the ones who *didn't* initially get the vaccine, their hesitancy rose. In other words, PhDs who started off a little hesitant got more hesitant. Those who didn't... actually got the vaccine! Their hesitancy didn't rise or fall because they were already vaccinated!

Conclusion: PhDs are more likely to become entrenched in their initial beliefs.
