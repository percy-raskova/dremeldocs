# @lavendelundrot Microclover

@lavendelundrot Microclover! I refuse to mow, fertilize, drive out pollinators, or waste water on something as petty as a lawn.

It's too late to do much growing now, but once winter passes, I'll be growing flowers, berries, onions, peppers, tomatoes... all sorts of fun stuff! @lavendelundrot Clover also spreads via stolons, and its leaves are broad enough to cover the whole ground, so it quickly edges out any weeds. And right now is the perfect time to plant, since it hates growing when it's too hot, but it needs a few weeks to get established before the frost.
