# t aware of what

There are a LOT of people who get sick of me refusing to let them just pretend they aren't aware of what's going on. I have explicitly been told "I don't like to think about those things." Not "You're wrong," but "I don't appreciate that you're telling me this." Back to back quote tweets about what specific thing I mean by "refuse to let them pretend they aren't aware."

Both correct. I'm talking about COVID, I'm talking about Palestine, I'm talking about all of it. I'm a communist: I can walk and chew gum at the same time. https://t.co/qzkB1q6Yp7 I have garnered a lot of resentment for that over the years. I speak passionately, rationally, incisively, and perhaps a bit bluntly. But I refuse to let people hide behind ignorance. If you want to continue on living a "normal life," you deserve the cognitive dissonance. I don't apologize for that. I don't demand perfection, but I always expect better of myself and better of everyone in my life.

Better than what? Better than before you were aware. Better than before you started trying. If you're not even trying, I don't have patience for you. I know that makes me sound "arrogant," like I have all the answers. I don't. There's an unknowable number of things I don't know, and I acknowledge my fallibility all the time. I'm not afraid to change my mind if I learn new information. But I have confidence in my analyses. I'm exactly as sure in my correctness on an issue as I am in the completeness of the data I've collected. If I suspect or know that there is more out there I don't understand, I don't present my opinions as unimpeachable. If not, I act with moral certitude. I will never apologize for thinking I'm right, when I spend all my time studying and analyzing to try to *become* right.

And I am eternally grateful for those people who appreciate me for my clarity of purpose and uncompromising search for justice and truth. Fuck everyone else.
