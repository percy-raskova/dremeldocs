# @Dr_Marxist_27 I've been saying this

@Dr_Marxist_27 I've been saying this. "Revolutionaries" have gotta get real comfortable with criminality, real fast, otherwise they're simply never going to do anything remotely close to revolution. @Dr_Marxist_27 And the major concern -- "But then the state will crush us into submission for breaking the law!!" -- can be assuaged by learning how to avoid getting crushed. Decades of police crusades against gangs have done nothing to stop gang operations, because they're highly organized.
