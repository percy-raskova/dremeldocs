# love the sin, hate the sinner

Francis played a good game of "love the sin, hate the sinner"-style faux progressivism, and a lot of Religion-Apologist Leftists bought into it. But the next Pope is gonna remind you all what the Catholic church is all about and why communists don't fuck with religion. How quickly we forget the Lateran Treaty and the Reichskonkordat, both of which remain in force to this day.
