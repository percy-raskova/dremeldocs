After Italy, Japan, Austria, Britain, France, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, and Spain had all signed non-aggression pacts or territorial treaties with Nazi Germany, the USSR finally decided to solidify what they knew was a very temporary peace with them as well. üßµ Both knew this was a transient arrangement. Both saw the other as an existential threat; the Nazis' Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan, Italy, Hungary, and Spain made it very clear that communism was their primary enemy, and nullified Weimar-era peace treaties with the USSR. The Nazis and the Soviets both perceived war with each other as inevitable in the long-run, but disastrous in the short-term. Both were in the process of industrializing as quickly as possible to prepare for this inevitability, although the USSR had much more ground to cover. The USSR knew that it had to secure itself a separate peace -- especially after the Munich Agreement demonstrated that Britain and France had no intention of denying German expansion. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed to head off the Nazis nibbling at the USSR's territory. It was only once Poland refused to join the Anti-Comintern Pact that the Nazis broke their agreement and invaded. When they did, Britain and France declared war -- and then did almost nothing. Within 15 days, Germany had rolled over most of Poland, before the Soviets mobilized. The Soviet invasion of Poland was not some cynical war of opportunistic conquest: it was a defensive maneuver. The Wehrmacht had no plans to stop at the Vistula, per the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, as we can see from Franz Halder's war journal -- and the Soviets knew that. It was only once the Red Army arrived that the German advance was halted -- much to the frustration of the German High Command. Halder called it "a day of shame." Every world power at that time understood the dynamics at play: Germany was invading, the Soviets were stopping them. Ever wonder why Britain and France immediately declared war on Germany when they invaded, but were fine with the USSR "joining in"? It's because they knew it was not a joint operation. They were hoping fighting would break out between the two. But both were too smart for that. They both still refused to engage until they were "ready." Germany's main goal remained the complete domination of the USSR to put down the revolutionary government, subjugate the "lesser races," and expropriate the land. "The Volga must be our Mississippi," after all. However, it was now already at war with the western powers, whom Hitler perceived to be a more immediate priority. He knew he needed the industrial core of Europe in order to mobilize a sufficient military capable of what would eventually be the largest land invasion in history. The USSR on the other hand, also still needed to industrialize further. Preemptively making war with Germany at this stage would be disastrous. They knew the western powers would be all too eager to sit out the conflict and leave Germany to invade, pillage, and occupy them. (Remember the context: Britain and France had JUST demonstrated that exact attitude toward the invasion of Poland by not launching a full counter-offensive, or even providing Poland with any significant military armament. Before that, they had helped carve up Czechoslovakia.) So Germany halted to buy time for the Big Invasion, and the USSR halted to buy time for *defending* against it.

This was not a planned, joint conquest. It was Soviets ensuring that Germany got as little of Eastern Europe as possible, to further delay the brewing storm.
