# My favorite thing

My favorite thing about chatting with DeepSeek is how it keeps praising me for my insight and nuance.

My favorite thing is how that petty asshole always has to get the last word in ðŸ™„ Me: "[several paragraphs of carefully formulated reasoning that I spent 10 minutes reworking before sending]"

DeepSeek: "[1,000-word highly relevant essay, generated in seconds]"
