# Populations don't continue to grow exponentially

@BoldsHeidi Populations don't continue to grow exponentially. As areas develop, they undergo demographic transition and fertility rates stabilize around the replacement threshold of around 2.1 (mainly due to people having kids later in life). @BoldsHeidi The global fertility rate has already fallen to 2.3, with much of the decline coming from regions that have experienced economic growth. The population is still growing, but at the rate that growth is declining, we are projected to level off around 10 billion.
