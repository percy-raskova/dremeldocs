# the *mainstream* attitude

@RachelNagant Right, the *mainstream* attitude toward (Ashkenazi) Jews is still very much that we are white. I'm extrapolating from the emboldening of fascists to speak and act on their antisemitism, and how quickly similar rhetorical patterns have become the standard "conservative line." @RachelNagant And the speed with which "Jews are not white" can enter the mainstream is almost certainly dependant on the Zionist project. Unlike, say, the mainstreaming of fascist attitudes toward queer people, antizionism is still a nonstarter, and by extension, antisemitism.
