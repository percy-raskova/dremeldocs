# t mean it

When we say that capitalism is driving climate change, that doesn't mean it's impossible for a hypothetical communist utopia to contribute to climate change.

The point is that capitalism rewards corporations for externalizing environmental impacts. If you refuse to harm the planet in the name of profit, your corporation will have less capital, less market share, and less power. Those who are willing to do that damage will enjoy more profits, allowing them to expand their operation, and push you out of the market. By contrast, a system in which everyone has a stake in the means of production might cause pollution as a byproduct of industry. The impacts of that pollution are felt by the same people directing that industry, meaning they have both the interest and power to stop the pollution.
