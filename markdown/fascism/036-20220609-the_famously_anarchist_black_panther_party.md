# the famously anarchist Black Panther Party

Ah yes, the famously anarchist Black Panther Party ðŸ™„

https://t.co/Yl8kOvuLxA https://t.co/rWIoy1nq8d "In this country the anarchists seem to feel that if they just express themselves individually and tend to ignore the limitations imposed on them, without leadership and without discipline they can oppose the very disciplined, organized, reactionary state. "This is not true. They will be oppressed as long as imperialism exists. You cannot oppose a system such as this is to oppose it with organization thatâ€™s even more extremely disciplined and dedicated than the structure youâ€™re opposing."
