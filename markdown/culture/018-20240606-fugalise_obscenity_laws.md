# @fugalise Obscenity laws

@fugalise Obscenity laws are on the books in basically every country, including the US. And yes, they get misused all the time -- for example, in January of this year, when several Seattle queer bars were raided en masse. Which is why I specifically said I'm open to counter-examples. @fugalise I never claimed China was perfect -- or even good -- on queer rights. Just that it is not some uniquely censorious regime, necessitating the expungement of queerness from media in order to comply with the law. Chinese queer movies are produced all the time. @fugalise I'm sorry for getting defensive. Because you're right to point out that de jure and de facto oppression are not the same thing. I was writing for an imagined audience of people who believe that there is literally a system of "Don't Say Gay" laws in China. @fugalise I also specifically didn't say anything about the very real dynamics of the *culture* in China, which are frequently quite antagonistic toward queerness. Queer media is often seen as "unpublishable" by mainstream media outfits. @fugalise I don't know much about the incidence of hate crimes, but I'm sure they happen, and I wouldn't be surprised if they are not taken as seriously by authorities. I'm sure queer people in China face plenty of discrimination in the form of employment, housing, healthcare, etc.
