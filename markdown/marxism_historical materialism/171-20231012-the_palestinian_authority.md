# The Palestinian Authority

The Palestinian Authority has spent decades negotiating, bowing, and begging with a fascist occupation that refuses anything less than complete ethnic cleansing. They have played the exact game liberals now scold the resistance fighters for "ruining" and won absolutely nothing. And STILL, my entire life, I was told that the PA were rabid antisemites, terrorists, subhuman trash who wanted nothing but the destruction of the Jewish people. This is what collaboration earns you. And that's exactly why liberals whine when you stop playing along.
