# Anyone who promises a better world is a deceitful...

@NiaFrome This show was a paragon of liberal hegemony-laundering. Just a constant bombardment of "Anyone who promises a better world is a deceitful megalomaniac whose ideology seeks to subvert the proper order, and their success or failure is a matter of individual will and strength." @NiaFrome They kicked it off with a communist-aesthetic villain who first claimed to represent the will of non-benders being oppressed by benders -- which made him a villain because the show rests on the pretext that benders are super special and cool because they are naturally superior. @NiaFrome Then the "horror" of his ideology was revealed in the form of him taking away people's bending (Nevermind that all that does is subject them to the same status quo faced by the majority.) Pretty hamfisted allegory for how forcing capitalists to work is a crime against humanity. @NiaFrome And then, of course, it was revealed that he was actually a very powerful bender himself, was motivated by petty personal grievances, and defeating him alone caused the "movement" to immediately disappear and the notion of bender supremacy was never again questioned ðŸ™„ @NiaFrome Kuvira was presented as competent, principled, and an all-around positive force -- up until she committed the grievous sin of refusing to relinquish power back to its rightful place: an incompetent, selfish, entitled monarch. @NiaFrome Then, suddenly, we hear that she's committing war crimes off screen, and we see her randomly pivot from national liberation to imperialism and personal glory. She answers to no one and has no compassion for her loved ones. @NiaFrome People say she's supposed to represent fascism, but she's very clearly meant to represent the liberal caricature of Mao: unifying China, putting down warlords, ousting imperialists -- and also slaughtering millions, encouraging a cult of personality, and conquering everyone.
