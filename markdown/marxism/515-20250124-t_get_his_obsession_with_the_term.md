# t get his obsession with the term 

@Dr_Marxist_27 I don't get his obsession with the term "vanguard," considering that it's a Marxist concept. By all means, use whatever words you want within *your own* ideological framework, but if you reject the premise of Marxism, it seems weird to tell us we're defining Marxism wrong ðŸ¤¨ @Dr_Marxist_27 It would be like if I, an atheist, kept yelling at Christians debating whether salvation comes from faith alone or faith and good works, telling them "Actually, you awful chauvinists, Christian heaven is only for Scorpios. This shit is exactly why I'm not a Christian!"
