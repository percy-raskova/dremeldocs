# good faith

My experiences over the past 18 months have fundamentally altered my perception of "good faith." One of my sole metrics for trust now is whether or not you have been *and remain* opposed to in-person schooling during a pandemic. This is especially true for leftists, scientists, and labor activists. If your first and only priority has not been keeping people--especially children and their families--from dying, you are not my ally.
