# s impulse is to foster a 

@thrasherxy The fact that society's impulse is to foster a "viral underclass" is exactly why we *shouldn't* be calling monkeypox an STI. Unlike HIV, MPX spreads through non-sexual contact, and calling it an STI--and especially one that affects gay men--means people believe they can't get it. @thrasherxy And more significantly, it means the public health apparatus that failed so spectacularly with both AIDS and COVID can feel safe in ignoring this too.

It also means that when children inevitably get it (which they have started to do), it bolsters the "groomer" narrative.
