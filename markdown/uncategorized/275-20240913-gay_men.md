# gay men

@An_Aria_Blooms The obvious correct answer is that "gay men" should not be able to say it, but each individual gay man can earn the privilege.

As opposed to all lesbians automatically having the right to say f*ggot @An_Aria_Blooms This is the only scientifically valid conclusion.

Lesbians as a cohort are perennially subject to being "f*ggoted," whereas a gay man would only be a d*ke if he works hard to attain that status.

This all makes perfect sense, and I will not be taking questions at this time.
