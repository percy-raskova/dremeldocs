# I prefer they/them, but anything is fine

I have tried so hard to be one of those "I prefer they/them, but anything is fine" people. But honestly, it has just been weighing on me more and more, especially at my new job. Every time I hear "he" or "man" is like nails on a chalkboard at this point. One of my coworkers did "omg, GIRL!" me at one point, which felt amazing. And then hurriedly "Oh, sorry. That's just a thing I say."

Yeah, I know. It's a thing you say when you're with "the girls." Please keep doing it.
