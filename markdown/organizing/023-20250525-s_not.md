# s not 

The fact that CPUSA has existed for over a century, and in that time has not only failed to mount a revolution, but declined significantly since its peak, should tell you exactly why it's not "our party."

You are not entitled to the loyalty of communists by way of proclamation. https://t.co/xX9rvvjh2q Every successful communist revolution in history was waged by a party founded around 20 years prior. That's the timeline. If you take a little longer, you're dawdling. If you take five times as long, you're not a revolutionary party at all.
