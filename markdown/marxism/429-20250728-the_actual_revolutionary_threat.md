# the *actual* revolutionary threat

I should clarify that I'm not trying to diminish the *actual* revolutionary threat presented by this class -- quite the contrary. I'm positing that the state doesn't see that as its main priority, because they underestimate the capacity of the masses to organize.

Their mistake. https://t.co/ELirGN3sXA The state does make significant investment in counter-insurgency measures. But they typically treat it more like crisis response rather than "general maintenance." By far the greatest effort they make on that front is *class stratification*, not bolstering an economic floor. That is, buy the complacency of the volksgemeinschaft at the expense of the nationally oppressed, then use military, policing, borders, sanctions, culturecraft, segregation, ostracism, etc. to keep the rest  crushed into the dirt.
