# both sides

Not to get all "both sides" on this "discourse," but both the framing of the argument and much of the rebuke of it has been intolerable. Everyone is trapped within a liberal mindset, buying into liberal myths, and ignoring both medical science and revolutionary theory. https://t.co/FZwEYwQCdp And of course I'm not above it. None of us are. I fall into these traps all the time. But it's utter foolishness to never reflect and reexamine your assumptions, and where they come from.

(They come from the liberal ideology you were indoctrinated in from birth.) No, revolution is not something to take lightly, push away into the far future, manifest into being with good vibes, or strive for with anything less than everything we have.

No, "everything we have" does not mean a prescriptive assessment of physical or mental ability.
