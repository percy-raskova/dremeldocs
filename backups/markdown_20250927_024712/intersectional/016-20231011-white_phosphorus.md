# white phosphorus

I am seeing reports that Israel is dropping white phosphorus on Gaza, including videos that do look suspiciously like that. Although I would currently call these claims unconfirmed, Israel *has* used white phosphorus in the past: both in 2014 and in 2008/2009. While the use of white phosphorus itself is not a war crime -- despite the efforts of numerous human rights groups -- its use in civilian populations absolutely is. And it is one of many war crimes Israel has blatantly violated for decades, with absolutely no repercussions. Instead, it has been rewarded with a limitless supply of weapons, logistical support, and cash from its eager overlord, the USA. Not only does it receive annual gifts in excess of the GDPs of small countries, but every war crime seems to entice billions more in capital investment The efforts to smear the resistance as "violating human rights" are laughable in their sloppiness -- utter fabrications, while Israel's grotesque history of war crimes is universally confirmed. "International law" is not a real thing: it's only applied to the enemies of the west.
