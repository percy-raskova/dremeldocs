# @marwilliamson Bernie

@queue09 @JoshNold_ @NathanielNiznik @bobcat0803 @marwilliamson Bernie is definitely going to appoint a union person for Labor secretary. Yang's theory of the case when it comes to automation is completely different from Bernie's. Workers don't want to be paid off so we can sit on the sidelines of the economy. We want to *own* the economy. @queue09 @JoshNold_ @NathanielNiznik @bobcat0803 @marwilliamson The problem with a UBI that everyone is supposed to live off of once no one can get jobs is that it still gives corporations all the power. They still get to decide what products and services are produced, where they are offered, how they're sourced, etc. @queue09 @JoshNold_ @NathanielNiznik @bobcat0803 @marwilliamson They still make as much profit as they can get away with, financing obscene lifestyles as their reward for happening to own the machinery that produces their stuff. All they have to do is convince people to keep buying their stuff, which we can clearly see is very easy for them.
