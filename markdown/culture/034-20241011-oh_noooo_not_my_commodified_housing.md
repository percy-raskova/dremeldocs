# Oh noooo, not my commodified housing

Oh noooo, not my commodified housing!! Not my enclosure of the commons!! Not my rapacious conquest of the means of survival!!!! ðŸ˜¥

Who among you will stand with the latest innocent victim of CCP genocide: the poor, humble real estate speculators? ðŸ˜¤ #FreeBlackRock https://t.co/1El4pd0qOZ Before you come at me for being a "China shill," just know that I *do* have criticism of their approach.

For example, as far as I'm aware there have been ZERO public executions of real estate speculators, so in my view, they're being far too moderate. Remember that time when Evergrande was like "oh noo our rampant speculation turned out to be a bad investment ðŸ˜­ can we pwease have a bailout? ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆðŸ¥º"

And the government was like "lol. lmao. get fucked."
