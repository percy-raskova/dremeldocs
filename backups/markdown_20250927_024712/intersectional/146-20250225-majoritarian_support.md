# majoritarian support

It is impossible to build majoritarian support for something that *doesn't yet exist*. You have to have something to show people, a material reason for them to *act*. Anything less rests on you being able to tell hundreds of millions of people a REALLY convincing fairy tale. https://t.co/DiFupkg0Ff You can convince *some* people, with speeches and lessons and appeals to revolutionary optimism. Those are the people with whom you start build something *real*. The more you build, the easier it becomes to convince people of the necessity of what you're building. This is the path every single revolution has taken throughout history -- and not just communist revolutions. Only once you start winning will people see your ideology as the path to victory.
