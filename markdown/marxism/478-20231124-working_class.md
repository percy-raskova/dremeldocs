# working class

@_imwhtilike For one thing, they call it a myth that there exists a coherent concept of "settler," and insist that the *only* thing that matters is a loosely-defined "working class" that transcends all national boundaries, ignoring how imperialism alters that dynamic.

Obviously, different forms of oppression have different impacts on the overall structure of modern capitalism, but national oppression in general governs our entire world, through imperialist extraction and colonial domination.
