# Lenin would say "See guys

Lenin would say "See guys? This is exactly why we need to get our shit together and be THE place for people to regiment their revolutionary impulses, instead of burning themselves out in isolation. We dropped the ball, lost a potential soldier, and revealed our weakness." https://t.co/EP7Vs9918B You need to stop with the "Lenin would have agreed with [liberalism]" shtick. He spent decades building, fighting, and winning a violent revolution. You simply can't get around that. Stop trying to find that one magical Lenin quote that will move communists *away* from violence. Whatever quote you're trying to dredge up to make a specific point? Put it in the context of WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. All of it was progressing toward VIOLENT REVOLUTION. Sometimes he even changed his tune about the specifics along the way, but the end goal was always revolution.
