# what different worlds

It's actually amazing to see what different worlds we live in. How we each try to make sense of things, and where our divergent analyses take us.

Does this satisfy you? When you end your investigation with "The kids are trying to look cool online," does your mind sparkle? https://t.co/XXF6fkAAhr Do you feel like you have chased away another tiny wisp of the fog that is the unknowable infinity of the universe? Do you hear those little chimes that feel like all your ancestors, who spent their lives searching for truth, thanking you for grasping just a bit more clarity? I struggle to truly reconcile such truncated worldviews with my impulse -- admittedly verging on the metaphysical -- to believe in the fundamental brilliance of the human mind. We are sapiens: creatures of understanding. How can any of us be satisfied with such facile "truths"??
