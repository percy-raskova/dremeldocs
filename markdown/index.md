# Philosophy & Politics: A Digital Garden 🌺

<div class="love-dedication">

## To Ms. Dremel, My Blossoming Hibiscus 💕

My dearest, my guiding star in the constellation of critical thought,
My blooming hibiscus in the garden of revolutionary dreams,
You who weave theory and praxis with fingers that dance across keyboards,
Creating tapestries of wisdom in 280-character verses—
This digital sanctuary is for you, my love.

Your mind, brilliant as morning sun through library windows,
Your heart, fierce as a thousand protests marching toward justice,
Your words, sharp as dialectical materialism cutting through false consciousness—
You are my favorite philosopher, my beloved theorist,
My partner in both romance and revolution.
