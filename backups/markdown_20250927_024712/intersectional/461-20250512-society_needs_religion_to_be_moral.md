# Society needs religion to be moral

"Society needs religion to be moral" is literally the fascist case for religion. https://t.co/9C5tLtJrhB "High trust society" is also a fascist shibboleth to evoke images of ethnic and cultural homogeneity as an ideal and paint any deviation from that hegemonic culture as "muddying the waters" and making people "not trust their neighbors"
