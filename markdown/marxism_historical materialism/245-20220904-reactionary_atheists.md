# Reactionary atheists

@primarycatdad Reactionary atheists make absolutely no sense to me. I became an atheist and immediately started getting more and more radical and progressive by the day. @primarycatdad "Wait, if the rabbis were lying about there being an omnipotent, omniscient god, what else were they lying about? Gender? Sexuality? Race? Capitalism??? Wait... who's this Marx fella??"
