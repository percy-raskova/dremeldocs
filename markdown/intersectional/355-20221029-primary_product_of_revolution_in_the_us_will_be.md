# primary product of revolution in the US will be giving back...

The primary product of revolution in the US will be giving back everything the US stole. Even without paying restitution for death and suffering, that would still include:

-Land taken from native peoples.
-Wages never paid to enslaved people.
-Resources extracted from colonies. -Damages for infrastructure destroyed in wars.
-Damages for economic development blocked by embargoes and sanctions.

... to name a few.

It would fundamentally change the entire world, even before giving modern workers our due for stolen surplus labor. These damages would, of course, be extracted from the capitalists who have hoarded all this stolen wealth. In the course of revolution--if successful--many of those capitalists would of course flee, taking as much of their capital with them as they can. They would also bring with them as much of the US military as possible. Whatever place becomes their safe haven would naturally become the new center of global capital, and possibly global imperialism.

This is why revolution has to be international and ongoing. The capital flight from a revolutionary US would be qualitatively different from anything we saw from revolutions in Cuba, China, even Russia, with its incomplete capitalist development. The risk posed to the world by these displaced oligarchs could be catastrophic. This is one of the biggest reasons we can't just "smash the state" and be done with it. Chasing capital out of our borders is just the first step of revolution. We will need to end capitalism. Permanently.
