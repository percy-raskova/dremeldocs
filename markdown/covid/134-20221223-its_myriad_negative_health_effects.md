# its myriad negative health effects

Most people are not suicidal enough to expose themselves to SARS-CoV-2 and its myriad negative health effects. They literally do not know that's what they're doing. The image they have in their minds is of a completely different virus than the thing that's actually out there. Some people *are* selfish enough to expose *other people* to it though. Hence the false narrative constructed around "personal choice" and "vulnerable populations."

But even then, most people don't actually understand what they're spreading to those "other" vulnerable people.
