# the climate impact

Per capita CO2 emissions are a way of obfuscating the climate impact of the imperial core, which has offshored most industrial manufacturing to the periphery. Tracing economic activity all the way to its productive origins, the US is responsible for by far the most emissions. https://t.co/kQOmbsZKB6 This figure also ignores land use changes, which is not at all a trivial figure. The US economy is directly responsible for an astonishing collapse in the amount of carbon that can be absorbed by forests and wetlands across the planet.
