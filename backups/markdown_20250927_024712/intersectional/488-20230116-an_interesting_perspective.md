# an interesting perspective

@SpreadWhiz @Convict_No9653 It's an interesting perspective, but I would say not a particularly materialist one. I feel like it amounts to a form of "social storytelling," which can be metaphorically compelling in its own right, but which doesn't readily lend itself to material, revolutionary action. @SpreadWhiz @Convict_No9653 For example, the Soviet revolution was carried out in a region with one of the most culturally-entrenched Christian traditions. The "Third Rome," the historic "protector of Ottoman Christians" became the first long-lasting socialist society in the world.
