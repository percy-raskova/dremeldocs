# Armed resistance

Correct. Armed resistance should not be the focus of an organization with ties to the state, and this is exactly why: when presented with the choice between something that even has a *whiff* of militancy, or maintaining liberal compatibility, they will always choose the latter. https://t.co/QbpxMQuXLg Liberalism is so hegemonic in the DSA that they can't bear to even associate with another *totally legal* nonprofit organization that has absolutely no inclination toward insurrection or anything close to it. "Let's learn about gun safety!" is too far, because there is absolutely no context in which a liberal organization could conceive of guns even entering into the equation. Not as small scale community defense against fascist violence, and *certainly* not as means of liberation. The fact that "We have our tax exempt status to worry about!" is even a topic of conversation, let alone the *victorious* argument, is quite telling when it comes to teasing out what the *point* of DSA is, or how successful you can be in altering its trajectory. Eventually, you have to ask what it is that drives DSA to still -- in the year 2025, with Nazis in the streets -- have such its *dominant* tendency be "Ewwww, guns??? But that's what RADICALS use ðŸ¤¢" They can't even bear to *touch* radicalism, and you think there's a there there.
