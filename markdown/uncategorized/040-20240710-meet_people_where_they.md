# Meet people where they

"Meet people where they're at" necessarily comes with the explicit goal of bringing them *away* from where they're at. Where they're at is a morass. A fetid, swampy muck of liberalism, pulling them down and suffocating them. They are not served by you wading out to join them. Plant your feet on solid ground. Throw them a rope and when they grab it, heave with all you've got. If they refuse to take hold of the lifeline, there is nothing more you can do by moving closer to them.
