# stupid savages

@DecolonialMarx Using "neanderthals" as an epithet for "stupid savages" is one of the best heurisitics for knowing that someone A) is a Hitlerite and B) doesn't know what they're talking about. Neanderthals weren't brutish and unevolved. They were people. Stockier on average, but just... people. @DecolonialMarx They were so much like us that they didn't even really "die out," so much as get folded into the much larger demographic pool of *other* people. The group of sapiens who encountered them was about 10 times as populous -- and their modern descendants are ~1/20 neanderthal.
