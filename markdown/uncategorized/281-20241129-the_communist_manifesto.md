# the communist manifesto

@salvagingyouth I definitely don't think the communist manifesto is the best place to start, especially in our current context. My recommendation is usually Blood in My Eye, which gives a good look at the enduring relevance of communism as a tool of liberation to this day. @salvagingyouth It's always a good idea to read and discuss things in a group. You could try looking for an existing group nearby or starting one yourself.
