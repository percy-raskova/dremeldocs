# social issues

@orbrealm While I agree that the parties are using their disparate positioning on so-called "social issues" as branding exercises to solidify their appeal to their constituencies, I don't think it's a simple matter of cynical political theater. @orbrealm They AREN'T ambivalent on the issue, and I think I may have misrepresented myself if that's how my position came across. They have fundamentally opposed views on whether or not transness (and queerness more broadly) can be assimilated into the broader bourgeois social form. @orbrealm My point was that the metric of whether or not that is possible will be borne out (in the eyes of the ruling class) in time. The "progressive faction" will see for themselves just how potent of a wedge issue this is, and will not risk their grip on power to *reverse* that tide. @orbrealm As for *why* I believe this... well, that gets into a whole different topic, on the construction and maintenance of bourgeois culture, the role of gender, the family, race, nation, etc. Wayyyyy too much to get into here.
