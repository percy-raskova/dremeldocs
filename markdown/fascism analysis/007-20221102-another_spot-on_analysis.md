# Another spot-on analysis

@Rocko64_ Another spot-on analysis, comrade. Although I definitely think the same ruptures will happen in Europe, especially as the "neo"colonial order degrades and Europe continues to see waves of migration. They don't YET have the same critical mass as the US's internal colonies. @Rocko64_ But especially as the climate crisis worsens, and as the US continues to lash out to prop up its dying empire, we will absolutely see greater and greater sectors of the European populace that fascists will see as necessitating suspension of "civil procedure."
