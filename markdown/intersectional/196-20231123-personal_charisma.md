# personal charisma

This will never stop happening until we learn that personal charisma does NOT make someone a good leader. A leader is someone who educates and empowers. 

The paradox is that, when people are not yet educated enough, they can't tell whether someone is educating them correctly. https://t.co/qL2p2jT3gR Cult leaders are experts in presenting themselves as self-assured, kind, inspiring, and the repositories of some special insight that makes them uniquely deserving of your loyalty. They especially prey on people who are young, inexperienced, ambitious, and desperate for guidance. The ONLY way we can combat this is by building organizations that are firmly rooted in material struggle, revolutionary history, democratic centralism, and the constant reproduction of its membership and leadership. We can't keep letting our youth fall prey to domination by cults, any more than we can accept them getting assimilated into liberalism. We need to outflank opportunism with the hard work of deep, permanent, sustainable organization. We need a real party.
