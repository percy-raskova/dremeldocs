# tech bro, humanist, futurist types

Truly astounding that tech bro, humanist, futurist types can conceive of hypothetical futures with Dyson spheres and Type III civilizations and the like, but cannot even begin to reckon with the concept that we can do any better than capitalism. "What will humanity do when the sun burns away the Earth's atmosphere in 4 billion years?"

How about you shut up and work with us to survive the next hundred? Do you think these sci-fi interstellar societies got there by smothering themselves with CO2 at the whim of capital? Also, the Kardashev scale was brought to you by a Soviet astronomer. You know, that same Soviet system that literally made us a spacefaring species in the first place? You want to see the stars? Great. Get your head out of capitalism's ass and you'll see them better.
