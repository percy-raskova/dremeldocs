# specifically anti-Black fascist violence

@HollyBlomberg The reason I'm so angry is the timing of publishing this in the wake of specifically anti-Black fascist violence. There are certainly aspects of his general thesis that are valid, such as the tendency of liberalism to stultify liberation movements and vulgarize class dynamics. @HollyBlomberg However, it's also downright counter-revolutionary to contract liberation down to a context-independent model that denigrates national liberation, decolonization, and similar movements as being inherently a product of "neoliberal distraction." @HollyBlomberg It's a lazy take that seeks to avoid grappling with real, material contradictions upheld by the same beast, expressed in myriad arms of oppression that branch and re-intersect to condemn whole segments of the working class into imperial subjects. @HollyBlomberg Highlighting a "race-neutral" thesis like this -- particularly in the context of glaring racial oppression -- is par for the course for a magazine that is wholly uninterested in fostering actual revolutionary upheaval.
