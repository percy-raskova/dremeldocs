# a structured, ideologically unified organization

@makbethel The issue is that, due to the constraints of the format of this "discussion," (i.e. the fact that this is not a structured, ideologically unified organization with specific agreed-upon aims), there can NEVER be defined parameters for discourse. @makbethel This means that trying to argue for point #1 is easily derailed by accusations of arguing for point #2, which can then be much more easily defended.
