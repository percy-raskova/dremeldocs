# Protests are working as they always have

Protests are working as they always have. They're a release valve for off-gassing a pressurized population. Whenever they happen to "devolve" into riots, it's the happenstance of state forces foolishly standing in the way while the steam is ejected instead of letting it disperse. https://t.co/NoqhSYonCt When you see violence break out and mistake it for "escalation," you are falling into the spontaneity trap. Yes, the jet of steam might inflict some burns right now, but that heat is being *expended*, rather than routed into the superheated crucible of revolution.
