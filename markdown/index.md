# DremelDocs: A Revolutionary Archive Powered by CI-CD Pipelines

## The Material Base of This Collection

This archive contains the **Greatest Hits** of Twitter theorist and revolutionary A.V. Dremel as she migrates off of Twitter and onto platforms she has more control of. This archive documents over six years wroth of her revolutionary Decolonial Marxist theoretical work. It's not "carefully curated" in some liberal sense of respectability politics, but presented raw, with only basic filters to ensure only the most quality tweets are preserved. Each thread represents an intervention in the class war of ideas - applying historical materialist analysis to the concrete conditions we face under late capitalism, settler colonialism, and imperial hegemony.

## Preservation as Revolutionary Infrastructure

### Against Platform Dependency

Twitter is dying. Servers failing, engineers fleeing, infrastructure crumbling under the weight of one billionaire's ego. And when it falls, the [White South African Settler Manchild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) wants our theoretical work to disappear with it. This archive ensures that *cannot happen*. Every thread, every analysis, every intervention in the discourse - preserved outside the domain of collapsing platforms. It is organized by our categories, coherently composed and serving revolutionary aims.

### The Technology of Liberation

- **Local-first processing**: The natural language processing package runs on the open-source SpaCy library in Python. It is 100% locally run and can easily work off of any average computer no fancy GPU required! This ensures privacy and accessibility because it's absolutely free.
- **Static generation**: These files will outlive every platform, every database, every proprietary system
- **Programmatic Website Creation**: The Python `MkDocs Material` ecosystem creates a beautiful, rich user experience with robust and vigorous capabilities for automatic deployment that others can use as a template for their own archives
- **Mobile friendly**: Because not everyone has a desktop, but everyone needs access to revolutionary theory

*This archive exists because the revolutionary movements in AmeriKKKa seem to suffer from a curious case of organizational amnesia. Social media whittles away our attention spans. This is an attempt to reclaim that, as well as cure that amnesia.*
