# First of all, Lenin was not omniscient

First of all, Lenin was not omniscient. His understanding of the situation a world away was lacking.

Second of all, later in that same letter, he went on to explain that communists should have no allegiance to "their" bourgeois-created "fatherlands."

Lenin calls you lackeys. https://t.co/U1MdWSl8Z5 https://t.co/5hQwxvJSXa Letter to American Workers.

Note the general, hand-holding tone he adopts, to avoid making whiney, underdeveloped Americanists just tune him out in favor of reveling in bourgeois nationalism.
