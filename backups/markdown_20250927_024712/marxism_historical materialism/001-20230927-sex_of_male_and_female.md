# sex of male and female

@nardorum @5HAW4RMA The "sex of male and female" is a socially-informed categorization that places particular emphasis on specific collections of material traits that do not necessarily correlate with each other. There is no special significance to these traits other than what gets assigned to them. @nardorum @5HAW4RMA Individual traits obviously have material impacts. For example, the capacity to get pregnant is dependent on a series of biological structures and biochemical pathways, any number of which could be present, absent, or altered in such a way that impacts an individual's fertility. @nardorum @5HAW4RMA Whether or not someone has a larger amount of breast tissue, however, does not have any impact on fertility. The two traits are commonly "sexed" together by society, but have no biological impact on each other. @nardorum @5HAW4RMA Likewise, having 2 X chromosomes does not automatically cause one to develop all -- or even *any* of the socially-defined traits of "female sex," given any number of factors, such as chromosomal transposition of the SRY gene.
