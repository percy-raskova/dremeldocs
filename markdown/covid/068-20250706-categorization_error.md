# categorization error

@Leannenist It's a type of categorization error. Come up with an ad hoc definition of vaguely defined categories, then focus on whatever emergent differences you can find as justification for the categories. They may as well have coined "kiki food vs bouba food." @Leannenist The actual relevant distinction is between food that is very easy to digest and not very filling vs food that is satiating and therefore hard to overeat. And that distinction mainly matters in the context of food overabundance, paving the way for obesity and its health impacts.
