# the overall spirit

@Convict_No9653 Yes, but only in the sense of the overall spirit, *not* the specific path taken in feudal societies. In other words, holding vital territory where the state has little influence, putting constant pressure on the enemy, baiting them into places where you hold advantage, etc. @Convict_No9653 In the US, there is plenty of urban and rural territory where the state has consistently either failed to exert any influence, or is an active source of repression. We would be fools to take the doctrine of Mao literally and simply copy/paste it wholesale. The US is a patchwork. @Convict_No9653 The key governing philosophy is always being able to identify the fracture lines and linchpins of the contemporary mode of production. At every step of the process, there are workers whom we need to radicalize and empower. We "hold territory" in ways other than simple land grabs. @Convict_No9653 Modern capitalism is obviously much more complex than feudal China. Different supply chains, different regional cultural influences, different power structures. We analyze those and come up with what would inevitably be a more complex military and ideological program. @Convict_No9653 The people we hope to win over will have more specific needs to be met. We can't just help them secure food and physical safety, but also modern medicine, transportation, a wide variety of consumer goods, etc. That inevitably means gradually building up our own production chains. @Convict_No9653 That would make us more cumbersome than the guerilla fighters of less developed economies. Which means a greater need for mass support. Which requires greater ability to provide things people need/want. It's a feedback loop, just like Mao originally laid out--just more complex. @Convict_No9653 It's why modern western Maoists bug me. They want to skirt around the necessary building up stages that allow us to wage such a Protracted People's War. It's adventurism, rather than constructive, tactical maneuvering. Mao would not do the exact same thing here that he did there.
