# @Tdltoby @ahandvanish

@Tdltoby @ahandvanish There's a lot of arrogance in the medical field. Probably because they went through so much education that they have internalized the idea that they've learned everything there is to know. And they can't accept that people can educate themselves without all that formal education. @Tdltoby @ahandvanish The best doctors, just like the best researchers, are the ones that keep themselves up to date on the constantly evolving literature. And that embody the scientific philosophy of "It's better to *realize* you were wrong than to continue *being* wrong."
