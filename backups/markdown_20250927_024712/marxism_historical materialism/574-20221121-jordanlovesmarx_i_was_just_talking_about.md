# @JordanLovesMarx I was just talking about "activists" with...

@JordanLovesMarx I was just talking about "activists" with a comrade. The short version of my thesis is that they really do want a better world, but in the absence of any progress, their brains naturally latch onto the "feeling" of progress by being part of progressive-sounding formations. @JordanLovesMarx And the solution to that is actually pretty simple: we need to actually build something that creates *real* progress. And upon seeing that, they will be naturally attracted to us over the fake stuff. Which, of course, injects more energy, labor, and resources into our project. @JordanLovesMarx Progressive activists are neither the core of revolution (that's Marxists) nor the bulk of it (that's the broader masses), but they are still a part of it. Or at least the ones who can be brought over this way are. Plenty of them just have competing class interests ðŸ¤·
