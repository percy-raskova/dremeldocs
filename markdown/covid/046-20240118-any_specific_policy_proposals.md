# any specific policy proposals

@Imani_Barbarin I would add that it's not even just the lack of any specific policy proposals or coherent arguments being made: people simply do not believe that ANYTHING these people say has any bearing on reality. The sheer depth and breadth of the lies is beyond rationalizing away. @Imani_Barbarin When you promise to end the pandemic, and instead you end pandemic *measures*, and then brag about it, people don't trust you.

Same when you pass a law mandating the leasing of 62 million acres of land for fossil fuel use and call it "the most historic climate bill in history." @Imani_Barbarin Same when you promise to protect queer people, and anti-trans measures explode all over the country. Or when your response to Obergefell being on the chopping block is to pass a law that doesn't actually codify gay marriage. @Imani_Barbarin When your response to genocide is to support it so enthusiastically that you can't even wait for congress to rubber stamp extra weapon funding, people notice.

And they will never believe you when you promise any policy that goes against your consistent actions.
