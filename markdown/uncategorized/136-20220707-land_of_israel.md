# land of Israel

@EmCohen_ Growing up in what was essentially a Zionist cult, I was taught to mind the difference between the biblical "land of Israel" and the modern "state of Israel". I was taught that in the end times, the Messiah would come and transform the State of Israel into the Land of Israel. @EmCohen_ Actually, there are supposed to be *two* Messiahs. The first would wage a bloody conflict with "all the enemies of Israel," ushering in the eternal kingdom of God.

In case you're wondering why many Jews claim to be "for peace" while doing horrific violence.
