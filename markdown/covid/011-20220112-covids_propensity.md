# COVID's propensity

@hjelle_brian Due to COVID's propensity for attenuating innate immune response and delaying adaptive immune response, I would predict that resistance to omicron reinfection would be based entirely on the level of serum antibodies, which declines over time.

https://t.co/SRe9djMxuY @hjelle_brian We'll probably all be pretty safe from *severe* illness. But the virus will be able to keep circulating through the population, ready to flare up again as soon as random mutations happen to bring severe symptoms again.
