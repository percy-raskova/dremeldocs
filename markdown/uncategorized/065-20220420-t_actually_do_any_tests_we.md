# t actually do any tests: we

@daveforbmore This gives me a great idea for a scam drug test company where we charge less than a normal drug test because we don't actually do any tests: we're just there to take people's urine, so they get scared off if they have any drugs in their system. @daveforbmore In 2021, only 0.69% of employer drug tests tested positive for anything other than marijuana. So it's really just a waste of time, money, and lab space. May as well save some cash by contracting ScamCo Labs!
