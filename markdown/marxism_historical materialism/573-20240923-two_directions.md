# two directions

@lavendelundrot It's a dialectical relationship, where people materially benefit from a system that still exploits them, but exploits others way more brutally, so their class instincts pull them in two directions. The default is to lean into the more powerful instinct to protect what they have. @lavendelundrot Engaging with these contradictions requires actively repressing that protectionist instinct, in favor of identifying with and advancing the universal struggle. "Empathy" is not enough, and it cannot be taught -- only nurtured. Solidarity and critical analysis *can* be taught.
