# principled stance

Notice how the "principled stance" is to oppose everything and support nothing. How nice it must be to live in a world where you can watch from afar, with full moral absolution, as the world moves around you, asks nothing of you, and will never challenge your place in it. https://t.co/tqzYW5PsuG How lovely and peaceful the world must be to those who stand above it. All the turmoil is the petty squabbling of lesser beings, less capable of principle and reason than you. Their soiled hands will never touch your gleaming robes. Oh the jealousy that rages in my heart, to never be able to reach such enlightenment as "All the empire's enemies are my enemies, but the empire does not act in my name!" All the plunder of empire with none of the guilt -- all thanks to Principles™️!
