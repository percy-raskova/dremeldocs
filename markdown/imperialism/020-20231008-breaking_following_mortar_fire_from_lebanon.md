# "ðŸš¨ BREAKING: Following mortar fire from Lebanon towards IOF...

"ðŸš¨ BREAKING: Following mortar fire from Lebanon towards IOF sites near the border with Palestine, settlers have been asked to seek shelter."

Previously, it was reported that IOF opened fire on a group gathered at the border to celebrate Al-Aqsa Flood.

https://t.co/PRR3t6GL97 This marks a return of fire, presumably by Hezbollah (whose flags the group had been waving earlier), and an escalation of the conflict to include more resistance forces. "ðŸš¨ BREAKING: The IOF bombs sites in southern Lebanon with artillery fire following a mortar attack on IOF positions from Lebanon."

And IOF returns fire back. It's probably safe to say Lebanon is fully part of this now.

https://t.co/cBSoxkWvns "ðŸš¨ Dozens of young men reportedly attempted to infiltrate the border between Jordan and occupied Palestine moments ago."

Possibly Jordan too. This seems less confirmed however, and so far, no exchange of fire.
