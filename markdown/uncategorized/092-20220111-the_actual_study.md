# the actual study

@LisaMcCray I just read the actual study referred to in the article. What they actually report is that viral aerosol loses infectivity quickly, then that loss plateaus at around 20 min. Then they stop checking, despite previous studies showing that viral aerosols can still infect for hours. @LisaMcCray A good comparison is a pot of water at a rolling boil. When you turn off the stove, it stops bubbling almost immediately, but the water can still burn you for a looooong time afterwards.
