# Communist organizations

"Communist organizations are compromised, go with the capitalist solution to labor getting too chummy with communist organizations."

I guess it makes a certain kind of sense. At least this way, you don't have to wonder who the collaborators are: they're running the show! https://t.co/BOVOiViQMW The task of communists when it comes to labor is the same as our task with all other social spheres: show people a better way. Nurture the existing radical elements within organized labor, educate workers on historical failures, broaden horizons past economism, etc. "Join a union" is the equivalent of "go vote!"

I'm lucky enough to have met and worked with some phenomenal unionists with unrelenting principles and an unquenchable thirst for justice beyond the walls of the workplace. Yet the context they work in holds back their progress.
