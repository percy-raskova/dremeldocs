# manmade chemicals

@uncle_authority Literally just had a coworker (a BIOLOGIST) tell me today that grocery store bread is poisonous because it contains "manmade chemicals," and when I asked her what chemicals specifically were so poisonous, she said "Look, you can just go ahead and keep being stupid if you want." @uncle_authority "Stuff that, you know, if you ate a spoonful of it, you would die."

Soo... like vitamin C? Is that poisonous now?
