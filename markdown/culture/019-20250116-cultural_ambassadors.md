# cultural ambassadors

@comrade_pabs They could have just appointed Jews as "cultural ambassadors," sending them abroad to schmooze with the foreign elite. They could have built up pretty "Jewish towns" to give tours while showing off Jewish culture. They didn't, because... that's not how genocide works. @comrade_pabs The liberal capacity for credulity is ASTONISHING. Somehow, China is waging the first ever genocide where they cover their tracks by parading around the targeted ethnic group as "a vital part of Chinese culture" and forcing 1.4 billion to smile for the cameras and NEVER speak up.
