# heat-related deaths

"We're gonna institute measures to protect workers from heat-related deaths!"

... and the proposal is to give employees time to acclimatize to deadly heat, plus giving capitalists a fee schedule for how much it costs to let their employees suffer. https://t.co/toRRiHDbMK Here's my proposal:

If an employee dies due to unsafe workplace conditions, it's a capital offense. If the company is found culpable, its owners and executives are executed. For workplace injuries, the penalty is 20 years in prison.
