Congratulations! You found the secret file!

But the real secret is... there's no secret.

Just a philosophical Twitter archive.

However, since you worked so hard to find this:

Here's a ASCII art cookie for your efforts:

While you're here, some fun facts:

1. You probably found this with: find . -name "*.txt" or grep -r "secret"
2. This took you approximately 0.003 seconds with automated tools
3. Your bash history probably has some embarrassing typos
4. Control+R is the best bash feature (you're welcome if you didn't know)

Since we have this moment together, here's some life advice:

- Drink more water
- Call your mom
- That bug isn't in the library, it's in your code
- The real treasure is the surveillance we detected along the way
- Tabs vs spaces doesn't matter (it's spaces though)

Easter Egg Counter:
If you're keeping track, this is Easter Egg #7

Next Easter Egg hint: Check the commit messages for acrostics
(Just kidding, there aren't any. Or are there? 👀)

Remember: A file named ".well-hidden-secret.txt" is an oxymoron.
Kind of like "military intelligence" or "corporate ethics".

Stay curious, friend!
