# Colonialism isn

"Colonialism isn't about the settler working class" is an incomprehensible position for Marxists to hold. Do you not understand the construction of national identity as a vector of exploitation? How the nation was designed to supplant class in the public consciousness? This thread was supposed to be speaking generally about a persistent strain of infantilism among Western "Marxists." Didn't realize I was accidentally addressing something specific ðŸ™„

https://t.co/5TFTQYPXtb You can emphasize all you want that racial, ethnic, and national boundaries are constructs, but that doesn't mean they aren't MADE real by their use in the hegemonic, hierarchical structure that ennobles the material relations of our global society. These and other social constructs aren't just "hiding" economic conditions -- they ARE economic relations. That's what they were constructed to do. This is exactly why the settler-indigenous relation is primary, and cannot be ignored in favor of "real class relations." The entire point of constructing the settler identity is to *materially* benefit  that entire class, above and beyond those who are displaced, enslaved, murdered, segregated, denied infrastructure, etc. The "fake" delineation is as real as the delineation between rich and poor. Money is also a "social construct," and you would be rightly laughed out of the room for claiming that the division between rich and poor is a distraction from "real differences."

... Laughed out of every room except one full of fascists, that is. Entire libraries have been filled with literature on decolonial theory, and Twitter is not really the best place to expound on the specifics of why it's SO important. My point here is simply to point out how obviously infantile the assertion is that we should just brush it off. In summation, fuck Midwestern Marx, fuck the "Israeli left," fuck social democrats, fuck "bill of rights socialism," fuck any vague "leftist" whose goals do not entail the total uprooting of all colonial, imperialist entities.
