# the zoning board strategy

For the past decade, I have committed myself to the zoning board strategy. I have joined 67 zoning boards so far. My schedule is absolutely PACKED with zoning board meetings, where I advocate for sustainable development. Emissions have plummeted, thanks to my tireless efforts. https://t.co/UzbNfD75Vx I have worked very hard, but it's been worth it, because my hometown is now 80% parks, 15% bike lanes, and 5% sustainable multifamily housing (yours for only $5,000/month!!)
