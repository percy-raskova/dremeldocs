# their upbringing

@stimulosus As someone who grew up Orthodox Jewish, I was CONSTANTLY laughing at Christians/ex-Christians complaining about how repressive their upbringing was. Ohhh you had to go to church once a week?? ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

MY EVERY WAKING MOMENT WAS DICTATED BY THE RELIGION. @stimulosus At least with Muslims, I could commiserate with the praying multiple times a day, the fasting, the dietary restrictions, the dress code, etc. even if it still felt less prescriptive than Judaism. For example, they didn't have one day a week where they couldn't use electricity lol
