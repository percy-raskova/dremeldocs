# a very nice (and very talkative) BGE technician

Just got super duper correctly gendered by a very nice (and very talkative) BGE technician.

"Hi, are you *looks at me for less than a tenth of a second* Mrs. [Lastname]?"

The entire time she was here, I got the distinct impression she truly *saw* me the way I wanted to be seen. She came to install a more efficient showerhead, saw me in a mask and immediately offered to wear one too. We vibed over shared Romanian ancestry, talked about science, etc. Very pleasant encounter.
