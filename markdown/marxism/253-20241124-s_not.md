# s not 

@assthethiccs It's not "harmful," it's just silly.

I would say it's "taking away energy from fighting actual oppression," but it's really not. If you would get "distracted" by xenogenders, either pro or anti, you were never going to fight for gender liberation in the first place. @assthethiccs I only bring it up as emblematic of a particular, largely western conception of oppression that revolves around the self, rather than the class. *That* is what's harmful: the tendency, not any particular iteration.
