# technology won

@BlackRedGuard1 There is a worrying contingent of luddite leftists, who say things like "technology won't save us" and clearly have a flimsy grasp of science.

No, of course technology by itself won't save us. Technology by and for the people absolutely will improve material conditions. @BlackRedGuard1 I think it's a reaction to the Elon Musks of the world. The kinds of people who try to solve fake problems with an ineffective solution and make trillions doing it.
