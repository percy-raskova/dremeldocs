# @ahoy_polloi @Rocko64

@ahoy_polloi @Rocko64_ These aren't "rules" in the sense of "how the game is played." More like logical inevitabilities that arise from the fundamental nature of the capitalist system. By definition, capitalists can't ever escape the need to make profit, and from that truth, corollaries can be drawn. @ahoy_polloi @Rocko64_ It's hard to condense into a couple of tweets, but the point is that these aren't just rules of engagement, but internally-consistent "natural laws" that emerge from the basic fact of how capitalist production takes place. Feel free to DM if you want to discuss more!
