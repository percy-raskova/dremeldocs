# The entire premise

@m1vql1hdwt The entire premise is based on conflating the liberal vulgarization of "decolonial" with the real movement to actively defeat colonialism. The author consistently attempts to pare down the movement to "identity politics" and derides so-called "anti-universality." @m1vql1hdwt Obviously, there is a need for Marxist repudiation of liberal defanging of "decolonization" into being nothing more than brushing away the cultural sins of "racism" and "eurocentrism." But in this article, he bundles that into legitimate decolonial theory and attacks them as one. @m1vql1hdwt His persistent gripe against the "ban on universalism" betrays an unwillingness to particularize the specific, material relations between settler and indigenous. (Or to examine the US's enemies, especially China, as anything other than simple "autocracies.") @m1vql1hdwt He seems to want to collapse everything into "it's capitalism that's bad, not the global empire from which it is wholly inextricable." In such a framework, it's elementary to imagine a false "socialism" that doesn't dismantle that empire or the horrors it inflicts on the world. @m1vql1hdwt Indeed, this has been the main thrust of most Jacobin articles. They have railed against the concept of scaling down production to forestall climate change, defended Sweden's disastrous pandemic policy, and consistently advocated for "Nordic model" social democracy. @m1vql1hdwt Coming from an actual Marxist source, denunciation of liberal faux "decolonialism" as doing nothing to address the material forces would be well-positioned. But Jacobin positions the very concept of colonialism itself as something of a pet issue for unserious actors.
