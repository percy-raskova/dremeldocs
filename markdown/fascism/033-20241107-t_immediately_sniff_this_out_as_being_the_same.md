# t immediately sniff this out as being the same liberals...

If you can't immediately sniff this out as being the same liberals posting about reporting Latinos who voted for Trump, telling trans people they can't wait to see us in camps, telling each other not to patronize Arab-owned businesses, etc. then I don't even know what to tell you https://t.co/A0fJdJ2qf9 They are HUNGRY to prove to us just how fascist things can get, by embracing fascism to "punish" us for "failing" them.
