# s something grimly comical about the fired NLRB members...

There's something grimly comical about the fired NLRB members suing for wrongful termination -- a case which can't be pursued by the NLRB, since they don't have a quorum. Liberals have exactly 1 tool in their tool kit, and when you remove it, they still reach for it reflexively. Wilcox says she'll "take it to the supreme court if necessary," which is just... lol.

Anyway, organized labor was never about asking nicely for the right to ask nicely. You don't need labor law to protect you; you need labor.
