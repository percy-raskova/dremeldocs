# @PuppygirlMao "How could you possibly think Assad was...

@PuppygirlMao "How could you possibly think Assad was keeping Israel in check? Assad is gone, and now Israel is running rampant, thereby proving that Assad was NOT keeping them in check!" @PuppygirlMao I left my door unlocked, and someone broke in and stole everything. This tells me the lock was in league with the burglar the whole time, and now the burglar is taking revenge on me for ousting the lock. I am very intelligent.
