# rise in antisemitism

Rather than a "rise in antisemitism," I think what we're seeing is the end of a historical blip of begrudging acceptance of Jews. One that I'm pretty sure lines up specifically with Zionism: Jews only became "white" once European Jews began doing European colonialism. The persistent conflation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism kinda gives the game away. The perception of our ethnic identity as being wrapped up in a genocidal project should tell you exactly what it really means to be "white," and therefore protected from racialized violence. The image of a "Jew" in the minds of most is almost exclusively Ashkenazi Jews--deliberately so. The ethnic cleansing of African, Arabic, and Indian Jews by Zionists is emblematic of the efforts of Zionism to be a European--not a Jewish--colonial project. The more we, as Jews, assert our opposition to colonialism, the more of a threat Jews become to the racially- and nationally-sorted global hegemony. As was always the case for Jews throughout history, hence our affinity for left politics (Jewish capitalists excluded, obviously). And of course, there is still a massive contingent of Jewish white supremacists, struggling to stay in "the club." But it's not working. Fascism has no permanent allies, and Jews have been on the shit list since day one.
