# @HollyBlomberg Correct

@HollyBlomberg Correct, they were not particularly interested in state-building, nor did they have anywhere near the numbers or capital to lead Palestinian nationalism. That's another of the "number of reasons" I alluded to for why Zionists couldn't use them as the locus for building "Israel." @HollyBlomberg A Palestinian nationalism would have been an Arabic, non-Jewish nationalism. The Old Yishuv would have been one part of that new nation, probably a somewhat marginalized part, as often happens to ethnic minorities within new nations. They might have had to struggle for equality. @HollyBlomberg They were certainly marginalized within the Zionist nation-building project, looked down upon and ostracized by the waves of European Jews that made up the New Yishuv. They faced exclusion and sometimes even violence at the hands of the European settlers. @HollyBlomberg Eventually though, many of them did find themselves aligned with the Zionist project. They wanted to be on the "winning side," rather than a minority in a secular Palestinian state. Many of their descendants are now among the most right-wing constituencies.
