# we don

The correct response to the lab leak "hypothesis" is not "we don't know." The preponderance of evidence points to zoonotic origins. In fact, it was likely two *distinct* zoonotic transmissions, leading to an A and a B lineage (the latter of which quickly outcompeted the former). This indicates that an ancestral haplotype of SARS-CoV-2 capable of infecting humans was circulating for quite some time before making the interspecies leap. There is absolutely no evidence to support an accidental lab leak. Practically the only way this could have come from a lab would be if multiple circumstances (not just the RBD, but the entire apparent genomic history, the early transmission patterns, etc.) were deliberately engineered to make it LOOK zoonotic in origin. It's the equivalent of claiming that the fossil record is fake, and that some conspiracy just fabricated fossils with particular chemical compositions and placed them at specific geological strata to trick you into believing in evolution. If you want to claim something this big, you're going to need an IMMENSE amount of evidence. "Lab leak" necessarily means "I think there was a massive, deliberate effort to unleash a deadly pathogen on the planet." You need to establish motive, capability, and method of action. Two federal intelligence agencies saying "Based on evidence that we can't show you, our biggest geopolitical rival probably did this" is NOT evidence. Not even close.
