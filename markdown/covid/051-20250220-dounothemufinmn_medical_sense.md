# @dounothemufinmn Medical sense

@dounothemufinmn Medical sense: a particular component of the virus that causes covid gives the virus the ability to shut down a particular component of our cells. Namely, the part that that our cells use to tell the immune system "Hey, there's a virus in here! Please kill me!" @dounothemufinmn Twitter sense: I keep seeing people not only ignoring, but actively denigrating "covid freaks" for caring about a disease that is still here and still uniquely dangerous in a way that the NON "covid freaks" literally do not have the knowledge base to understand.
