# @colinbodayle I am SO into this stuff

@colinbodayle I am SO into this stuff. I was raised in a super religious Jewish community, and can read the Bible in the original Hebrew. Once I stopped believing in the whole religious aspect, the anthropologic angle tickled my curiosity for years. @colinbodayle It suddenly made sense why there are *two* creation myths back to back: the "seven days, god speaking things into existence" one, and then suddenly it starts over, and goes with the whole "mist came up from the earth to create everything" version. @colinbodayle Or how "elohim" is clearly plural, but gets translated simply as one of the names of a purportedly monotheistic god. Who very explicitly says "let US create man in OUR image."
