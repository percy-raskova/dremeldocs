# a developmental biology analogy

@m1vql1hdwt Here's a developmental biology analogy:

During development, your cells are constantly sending signals to each other to direct cell growth and differentiation for the purpose of growing a whole body.

These people think growing a body is icky, but the SIGNALS are super cool. @m1vql1hdwt Bodies are authoritarian. We need a non-hierarchical mass of cells, a blob that passively absorbs nutrients from the surrounding primordial goo.
