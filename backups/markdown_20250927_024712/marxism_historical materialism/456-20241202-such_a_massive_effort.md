# such a massive effort

The fact that Vietnam is able to undertake such a massive effort, largely on its own, is a HUGE triumph. Held back by centuries of colonial extraction, Vietnam liberated itself, withstood bombardment by the most powerful empire in history, and is now lapping it in infrastructure. https://t.co/NS49CXdK4e This is the power of Marxism-Leninism. Empires tremble and fall to the collective might of the oppressed peoples of the world.
