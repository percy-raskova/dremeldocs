# t think the west

@MountainChen4 Maybe. I don't think the west's ideological cohesion has degraded enough for the US to be ostracized within the "international community" (i.e. the countries it actually cares about).

War with China would certainly help accelerate that loss of cohesion though. @MountainChen4 And while China has studiously been working to help the global south uplift itself, and those nations will be on the side of China, they're not yet strong enough to stand up to the US-backed world order. In a broad geopolitical conflict, they would be entirely reliant on China.
