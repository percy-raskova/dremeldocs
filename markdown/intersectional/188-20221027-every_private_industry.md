# every private industry

@MaratLives If every private industry found its way directly into the hands of the workers of that industry we would see a fundamental shift in the dynamics of the markets. However, without central planning, the steelworkers would still need to exchange steel for food. @MaratLives Steelworkers in enterprise A would then need to compete with steelworkers in enterprise B to maintain their ability to purchase food. If they don't, B could push them out. Or enterprise C. It's a prisoner's dilemma: whichever enterprise breaks first starts accumulating power. @MaratLives My prediction for a post-capitalist world that doesn't start with central planning to eliminate the market mentality is essentially capitalist-like *groups*, rather than individuals. They could emerge from any corner of any industry.
