# do n't give a shit about bourgeois politics 

I don't give a shit about bourgeois politics. I reactivated because CPUSA liquidated the Austin club for being the most advanced formation in an otherwise empty shell of a "party."

The rationale was explicitly "You are TOO invested in national liberation and feeding the masses." Of course they have flaws: primarily, that they aren't going hard ENOUGH with the things that got them liquidated. I have a feeling that will change rapidly now that they aren't being actively sabotaged by those chauvinists, revisionists, and outright grifters.
