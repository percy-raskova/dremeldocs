# " analyses " always go the same way : conflate The Economy...

These "analyses" always go the same way: conflate The Economy™️ with the material reality faced by actual *people*, then call those people "confused" for not having a PhD in Bullshitonomics.

GDP is not a measure of general prosperity; it's a measure of capitalist appropriation. https://t.co/MSm76uJM9w "The vast majority of respondents, 72%, indicated they think inflation is increasing. In reality, the rate of inflation has fallen sharply from its post-Covid peak of 9.1% and has been fluctuating between 3% and 4% a year."

Everything is getting more expensive every single year. No one gives a shit that the rate at which prices are increasing has stopped accelerating. Prices got way too high, then they kept getting higher. Rent went way up, then stopped going up as quickly. We reached terminal velocity, our acceleration slowed, and now you're trying to tell us "At this rate, you'll slow down enough and never hit the ground!"

No one is dumb enough to believe it anymore -- except the beneficiaries of that constant drain.
