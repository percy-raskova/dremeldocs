# Jewish burial law

Jewish burial law dictates the following:

-Z'rizut: the body must be buried as soon as possible. Waiting a day or longer is only done in extraordinary circumstances
-Sh'mira: Someone should be designated to watch over the body until burial
- Tahara: ritual cleansing of the body https://t.co/bkpelfGZvd - Tachrichim: 100% linen shrouds in which the deceased is wrapped.
- Talit: if one was worn during life, the deceased should be covered in a prayer shroud with one of the fringes removed to signify it is no longer to be used.
- Aron: if a casket is used, it must be unadorned wood It is *preferable* for the body to be intact, but this is not even close to being a requirement. Organ donation is not only permitted, but encouraged. In the case of death resulting from dismemberment, *any* retrievable body part may be used for the burial. Burying these vehicles because "the bodies are trapped inside, and need to be whole" is an utter falsehood. Burying an intact body is so far down the list of importance in a Jewish burial, especially in the case of violent death. Far more important are speed and ritual cleansing.
