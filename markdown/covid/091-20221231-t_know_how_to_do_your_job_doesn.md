# t know how to do your job doesn

Just because *you* don't know how to do your job doesn't mean it's impossible.

@POTUS, I would like to offer my services. I can even draw up an initial plan pro bono if you'd like. https://t.co/oidLn7jKEk I don't have a lot of public health experience, but I have the most critical job qualification there is: actually wanting to do the job, instead of complaining that it's too hard.
