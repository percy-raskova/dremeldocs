# Palestinian liberation

I know I did this myself earlier today, but it really is kind of dumb for us to keep pointing out the onslaught of liberal condemnation of Palestinian liberation. It's not like it's surprising or anything. None of these people have suddenly shifted *away* from liberation. I mean, I guess if I have anyone following me who thinks liberals are at all a force for good, I should probably do whatever I can do disabuse them of that notion. But I'm pretty sure everyone who follows me understands that Democrats have been consistently genocidal on COVID.
