# average memory retention

9/11 was long ago enough that "doesn't remember 9/11" can now refer to a 30-year-old with average memory retention. https://t.co/sy7EVnH2B2 I happen to remember being a toddler, but someone forgetting seeing a smoldering building on TV when they were 6 is pretty standard fare 🤷‍♀️
