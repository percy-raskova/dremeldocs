# only 16 public schools

Right now in Baltimore: 
There are only 16 public schools where the water is safe to drink. 

Students there face disproportionate water insecurity during the school year. @daveforbmore says we need #waterbillreliefðŸ’§ to prevent cutoffs at home. #waterisahumanright My school is not one of those 16, by the way. I temporarily forgot about that when I used tap water during a classroom sugar crystal experiment, so I had to tell them we couldn't actually eat the rock candy we made.
