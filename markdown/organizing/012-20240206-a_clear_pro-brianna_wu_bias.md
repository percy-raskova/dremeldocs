# a clear pro-Brianna Wu bias

Is there any credible mainstream news organization that has disputed the claim that, between the 11th and 19th of August, 2019, Brianna Wu killed and ate the hearts of 17 children?

Because all I see is allegations from people with a clear pro-Brianna Wu bias. https://t.co/cT8Sssh3We And before you ask: there are DOZENS of eyewitness accounts. There's a list of the families of these children with testimony that I cannot disclose for privacy reasons. There are videos EVERYWHERE if you just Google it. It's honestly disgusting that you would doubt this.
