# derisive, judgemental connotation

@goutam_sloth In that case, "sheigetz" (for a man) and "shikza" (for a woman) has more of derisive, judgemental connotation. @goutam_sloth God, the things I heard growing up in an insular, deeply religious community. Rabbis making cracks about how I lived in "the [Yiddish slur for black people] part of town" 😵‍💫
