# On The Revolutionary Possibilities of Artificial Intelligence

## A Note From Persephone Raskova to The Reader

Firstly, this portion is written purely by the developer, Persephone Raskova.
It reflects her opinions alone,
and is not necessarily endorsed by Dremel
(although it is probably safe to say
that Dremel agrees with much of what is written here.)

My beautiful and brilliant partner, Ms. Dremel -
the woman whose tweets you came here to read -
agreed that as a condition of me developing this project for her
that she would consent to me having one page to educate folks
about the positive uses of AI.

I have a lot of pent up anger and rage
over the stupidity of so many 'Marxists'
who refuse to engage with
the most significant shift in the material base
so far in the development of this century.
But a wise female author named after a power tool
once told me that the best way to win people over to my side
is not to condescend them and thereby prove them wrong,
but rather to prove my own argument is correct
by demonstrating its validity in practice.
A Wise Chinese Man also once said this!

There are many valid criticisms of AI from the left,
to be quite clear!
I agree with many of these criticisms.
TO be specific and name a few:

1. Data Privacy
2. Environmental Impact
3. Lots of empty buzzwords
4. Surveillance

But most comrades who criticise AI,
never bother to investigate the very thing they're talking about!
This is clear as day to me,
as a person who is employed

## AIs Role in a Revolutionary Movement

### No Harm, No Foul

This entire archive was built using AI as a
**disability aid, a thought enhancer, and a time saver.**
I did not purchase anyone's data
nor did I deceive or trick anyone into handing it over.
All data used to generate this website
was given to me with the full and informed consent of its owner.
It's also just tweets from a public twitter account!

The AI did develop this code,
but as you can see nowhere in the code itself
is there any use of AI whatsoever.
In fact, it was the AI that suggested to me
my original approach was bloated and unnecessary.
Much as assembly machine language abstracts binary,
and assembly language abstracts machine lagnuage,
and C/Rust abstract away assembly,
and Python/Java/etc abstract away C/Rust,
so too do LLMs abstract away Python/Java/etc.
This is what the future of progress looks like.
Love it or leave it!

### ‚úÖ What We Did Instead

- Used AI locally to assist with code generation
- Maintained complete human oversight of all processes
- Built everything with open-source tools
- Kept all data and processing on personal hardware
- Used AI to amplify human creativity, not replace it

### Practical Applications for Revolutionary Work

Here's how you can use AI as a tool for liberation:

1. **Documentation & Archival**:
   AI can assist us in preserving radical history contained in the annals of corporate-controlled platforms before said platforms erase it due to censorship or simply because they went under (MySpace). AI can help process massive archives that would take years to organize manually. Dremel's tweets alone totalled nearly 100,000 words! That is the size of an entire book! And with the help of AI's rigor with human creativity and oversight, I - the developer - was able to parse it into readable essays as a weekend hobby project.
   And the best part?
   Her brilliant work is no longer contingent
   upon the egotistical whims of a billionaire
   such as Elon Musk.
2. **Translation & Accessibility**:
   AI can assist us in making revolutionary theory and radical texts
   available across language barriers.
   AI can also provide rough translations
   which human comrades can refine.

### 3. **Pattern Recognition in Power**

Analyze corporate documents, police reports, and government data to expose patterns of oppression that might otherwise stay hidden.

### 4. **Rapid Response & Organizing**

Generate templates for mutual aid networks, protest logistics, and community defense that can be quickly adapted to local conditions.

### 5. **Education & Skill-Sharing**

Create learning materials that help comrades understand complex theory or develop technical skills without academic gatekeeping.

## The Dialectical Approach

We must hold two truths simultaneously:

1. **AI under capitalism is primarily a tool of oppression**
2. **AI technology itself can be redirected toward liberation**

AI is much like a firearm, comrades.
Our oppressors in the ranks of the police use a handgun,
but so did the Black Panthers, the Vietnamese, the Koreans, etc.
Comrade Mao Zedong said, "All political power flows from the barrel of a gun."
And what is an AI, if not the digital equivalent of a powerful firearm?

## Learn the Tools

Want to replicate this approach? Here's your starter pack:

### Free/Open Source Tools

- **Processing**: Python with ijson for handling large datasets
- **Local AI**: Ollama for running models on your hardware
- **Static Sites**: MkDocs for creating searchable archives
- **Version Control**: Git for preserving history

### Skills to Develop

- Basic Python scripting
- Markdown for documentation
- Command line navigation
- Critical evaluation of AI output
- Data sovereignty practices

### Resources

- [Free Programming Books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)
- [Library Genesis](http://libgen.rs) - Free access to technical books
- [Local-First Web Development](https://localfirstweb.dev)
- **Reach out to the author of this project!**
  Ms Persephone Raskova would LOVE to talk to YOU and YOUR organization
  About AI, about cybersecurity, about using data, and about technology.

## A Challenge to the Left

Stop ceding technological ground to capitalists!
You let protestantism infect your mind,
and what have you to show for it?
Every time we say "AI is evil!" without qualification,
we're giving up territory in the struggle. Instead:

- **Learn**: Understand these tools well enough to critique them properly.
  There's plenty to criticise!
  Study the art of criticism and self-criticism
  and apply it to your own use of technology.
  Learn the difference between vibes-based whining
  and genuine criticism based on empirically demonstrable facts.
- **Experiment**: Try using AI for liberatory purposes!
  Creatively apply the dialectical science to your own material conditions.
  If AI was truly nothing but capitalist slop,
  Why would the capitalists go to such great lengths to restrict its export to China?
- **Share**: Teach others how to use these tools ethically.
  Be the change you want to see!
  Create the tools necessary for technical autarky.
  Stop complaining about Google's monopoly over knowledge
  and start **doing** something about it!
- **Build**: Create alternatives to corporate AI infrastructure.
  Research local models through programs such as Ollama.

- **Organize**: Form collectives around technological sovereignty

## The Real Question

The question isn't "Should we use AI?" It's "How can we use technology‚Äîall technology‚Äîin service of liberation?"

This archive exists because I refused to let Ms. Dremel's brilliant contributions to revolutionary thought disappear into the corporate void. I used every tool available, including AI, to preserve and share this knowledge. That's not capitulation to techno-capital‚Äîit's technological guerrilla warfare.

## In Conclusion

"The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house," Audre Lorde claimed.
She was dead ass wrong!
The masters tools work exceptionally well;
that's why they pay millions or even billions of dollars to use them!
The greatest possible virtue is liberation,
and liberation comes only through victory.

## Technical Details

For the nerds who want specifics:

```python
# Our approach
def process_archive():
    """
    - Stream processing to avoid memory limits
    - Local filtering instead of API calls
    - Human-in-the-loop for quality control
    - Zero corporate dependencies
    """
    return power_to_the_people
```

### What We Used

- **Language**: Python 3.8+ (free and open source)
- **Key Library**: ijson for streaming JSON (prevents memory overflow)
- **Processing**: 2-stage local filtering (no AI needed)
- **Classification**: Human pattern extraction (better than any AI)
- **Site Generator**: MkDocs with Material theme
- **Total External API Calls**: 0
- **Data Sent to Corporations**: None
- **Surveillance Enabled**: Zero

### What We Refused

- OpenAI's GPT API ($108 saved)
- Google's Cloud Services
- Amazon's AWS
- Microsoft's Azure
- Any corporate data harvesting

### The Result

A complete, searchable, permanent archive of revolutionary thought, built with free tools and community knowledge, costing nothing but time and love.
