# @TeachingBoi They're operating on old data

@TeachingBoi They're operating on old data. We still don't have very good epidemiological data about omicron's interactions with vaccination re: hospitalization and severe illness, especially because we don't have very good surveillance on the ground due to insufficient testing. @TeachingBoi What data we *do* have points to severe drop-off in vaccine effectiveness against *infection*, as well as massive increases in hospitalizations. Regardless of the actual percentage protection against severe illness, in terms of sheer numbers, vaccination is CLEARLY not enough.
