# Can we... can we stop

Can we... can we stop? Can we stop with the "epic owns" and the water jugs and the riot shield vanity mirrors and the linking arms while we peacefully let the fascists crack skulls? Can we get just a little serious? https://t.co/lE2Wsz7xpo I'm not suggesting we be mirthless, dour, and miserable. I'm simply suggesting there is a time and place for having fun, and it is NOT inches away from being brutalized. Stop imagining yourself and your comrades as invincible.
