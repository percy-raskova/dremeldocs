# the analysis and historical perspective

@marxistarsenal I appreciate the analysis and historical perspective. I don't think communists unfamiliar with the history even need this much background to understand and trust the fact that Palestinian Marxists have done their analysis and chosen to align with Hamas for the sake of liberation. @marxistarsenal It takes an unbelievable amount of chauvinism to say "Hmm... it's concerning to me that PFLP and DFLP are being dragged around haplessly by Islamists," as if they don't know their own history AND revolutionary theory. @marxistarsenal What kind of western savior nonsense does it take to say "I know better than the people ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN REVOLUTION"???
