# Yeah, it's odd, but not *completely* unprecedented

@maggiemae362 Yeah, it's odd, but not *completely* unprecedented. There is some evidence of immunological imprinting, where multiple exposures to previous strains (through infection and/or vaccination) hampers your ability to adapt to a new one. It's unclear if that's what's happening here. @maggiemae362 The authors offer other explanations, like the idea that those who received more doses were more likely to be extra cautious, so they would get tested more frequently and catch cases with mild or no symptoms -- the study didn't examine disease severity. @maggiemae362 They also suggest that with more vaccinations, people are more likely to engage in riskier behavior, thinking they're protected. This seems like a weak explanation to me; people with 0 vaccine doses are probably by and large not very concerned with the pandemic at all.
