@bmore_radical Honestly, I think this is the crux of the issue. It's a cultural clash between people who view street activity (squeegees, vendors, etc.) as adding color and vibrancy, and those who view it as illegitimate degeneracy, and want all exchanges to be stuffed inside sterile boxes. @bmore_radical Which, again, is a symptom of the deliberate overbearing capitalist culture-crafting, which inevitably fosters racist, classist, violent attitudes. And if you're not interested in ending capitalism, you will never have a solution to this constructed problem.
