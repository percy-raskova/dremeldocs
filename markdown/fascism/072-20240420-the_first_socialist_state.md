# the first socialist state

Lenin, 5 minutes after founding the first socialist state in human history: "Guys, come on, we need to get our shit together."

Dweebs, a century later: "Checkmate, authoritarians 😏" https://t.co/I2TmEsejWW Also, they were still in the midst of all-out war with the forces of reaction. They were figuring out how to build a socialist society from the ground up, how to feed everyone, how to root out chauvinism, and endless other problems. And STILL they found time for self-criticism.
