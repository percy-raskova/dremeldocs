# the indigenous population

Capitalists found a mountain of silver, enslaved the indigenous population, and replaced the silver with a mountain of corpses. For a century, it was the largest industrial site on the planet. What the Spanish named "Mountain of Riches," the Quechua call "Mountain that Eats Men." https://t.co/vRqTtNelXO The mines at Cerro Rico are still active to this day, even as the mountain collapses in on itself. The local ecology has been ravaged by diverting rivers to quench the machinery. The clouds of silicate dust that blanket the region leave inhabitants with a life expectancy of 40. Don't talk to me about mountains of corpses. Look at your own mountains.

Capitalism would hollow out the planet and replace the core with bodies if it was profitable.
