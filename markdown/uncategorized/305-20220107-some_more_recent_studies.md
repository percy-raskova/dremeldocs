# some more recent studies

There are some more recent studies that show that antigen tests might be more sensitive to omicron than I originally thought based on earlier studies. Still not quite as accurate as they were for earlier viral strains, and definitely not near the sensitivity of PCR. If they're readily available, get an antigen test. But if it's negative, don't act like you're free and clear. If it's positive, follow up ASAP with PCR to have a paper trail.
