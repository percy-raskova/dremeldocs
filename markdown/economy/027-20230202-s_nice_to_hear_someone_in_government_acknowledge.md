# s nice to hear someone in government acknowledge that the...

While it's nice to hear someone in government acknowledge that the pandemic is not over, I can't help but notice she is speaking out specifically against H.R. 382, NOT Biden unilaterally ending the public health emergency. "Viruses should not be politicized," ... and yet... https://t.co/4n6kCdPvt2 This is the first time she's mentioned COVID since... reminding people to get vaccinated in October. She doesn't wear a mask, let alone remind others. She doesn't decry the rampant COVID minimization from her own party.

Come May 11th, I expect to never hear her mention it again. Understand that, while COVID denial is a bipartisan effort, it is still politically savvy to point to the "other side" as being unreasonable. The policy will always be the same: "You're on your own."

She just wants to do it "the right way," i.e. the Democrats doing it.
