# an apartheid regime

@OpenlyReasoned The end of Israel is the end of an apartheid regime that is CURRENTLY murdering doctors and patients in the name of building an ethnostate. Meanwhile, Israel wants the eradication of Palestinians, as a people. Palestinians want plurinationalism, Zionists want racial purity. @OpenlyReasoned "Israel" literally has written into its legal code that the territory it holds is the exclusive domain of the Jewish people. Hamas, the dreaded "terrorists," lay out a vision in their charter of a democratic state that protects the religious and ethnic rights of all.
