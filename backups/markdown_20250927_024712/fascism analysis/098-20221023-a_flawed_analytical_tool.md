# a *flawed* analytical tool

@SpreadWhiz I'm not saying dialectics is a *flawed* analytical tool. I'm saying that people often apply it incompletely. They become satisfied with "this reaction is in a dynamic equilibrium," and leave it at that--which is fine for most applications! But there are more layers. @SpreadWhiz Those layers can also be viewed dialectically. There's also a dialectical relationship between the opposing forces and the reinforcing ones. There are infinitely tiny sub-interactions, going down even further than what we have been able to scientifically quantify. @SpreadWhiz I guess I'm not really saying "dialectics is simplistic." I really mean that people often don't appreciate how many tiny interactions there are at work within any system.
