# The same persistent, structural, ideological flaws

@AJustGoldenhand The same persistent, structural, ideological flaws I lay out here apply to them. Put simply, they're not a revolutionary party, but they think they are, so they're also not oriented toward the *formation* of a party. Which means no development potential.

https://t.co/OIz3tE9ts5 @AJustGoldenhand I haven't looked into the more specific claims people make about them -- packed with feds, sexual abuse, cultish atmosphere, etc. Not because I dismiss them out of hand, or wouldn't care if they were true. But because it doesn't change the bottom line of "this isn't The Party™️."
