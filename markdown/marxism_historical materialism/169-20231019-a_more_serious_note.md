# a more "serious" note

@soffbrownie On a more "serious" note (as serious as discussions of the historicity of an ancient book of myths can be), this map is from the time of Joshua, the initial conquest and Hebrew settlement of the land. It doesn't represent the biblical maximum extent. @soffbrownie This is a map of the Hasmonean dynasty, which ruled during the Second Temple Period, and *is* historical, rather than mythological. I'd honestly discount the historicity of any supposed maps before that point. https://t.co/NdX7nMBcwN
