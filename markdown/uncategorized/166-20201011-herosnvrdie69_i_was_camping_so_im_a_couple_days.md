# @herosnvrdie69 I was camping, so I'm a couple days behind...

@herosnvrdie69 I was camping, so I'm a couple days behind already. Still trying to piece together what's happening. @herosnvrdie69 Alright, so from what I can gather, we're already in the midst of a civil war, and it's the dumbest one possible because it's starting on Twitter.
