# @Rocko64_ Washing

@Rocko64_ Washing. When you wash chicken, your entire sink is now covered in salmonella water, and you'll have to sterilize it. When you touch anything else after that, same thing. You have a lot more opportunities to cross-contaminate than if you just cook it. @Rocko64_ And yes, soap kills bacteria. But not as quickly as heat, so you're likely to unknowingly be spreading live bacteria around, even if there's soap involved. You need to be scrubbing everything, so it's more of a hassle, and you're less likely to be as fastidious as you need to be.
