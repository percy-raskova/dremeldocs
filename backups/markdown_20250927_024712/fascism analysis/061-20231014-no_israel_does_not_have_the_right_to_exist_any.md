No, Israel does not have the right to exist, any more than the Third Reich did.

"But the Jewish people need a home!" Did the German people "need" lebensraum?

"But wherever the Jews go, they get repressed!" Dare to struggle, dare to win, cowards. Fascism is not liberation. The solution to being oppressed is to overthrow the oppressors, not to become them. Proletarian Jews throughout history have been at the forefront of revolution. It is only the compradors who preach the "liberation" of ascension to oppressor status -- which they already achieved. I would rather die fighting for liberation than kill to prevent it for others. I would rather my people unleash a thousand Warsaw Ghetto Uprisings than perpetrate a single Nakba.
