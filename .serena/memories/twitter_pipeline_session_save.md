# Twitter Philosophy Pipeline - Session Save
## Date: 2025-09-21

### Project State
- **Phase**: Implementation Complete, Awaiting Human Review
- **Progress**: 95% - Pipeline ready, theme extraction pending
- **Next Action**: User reviews 59 heavy-hitter threads and extracts themes

### Key Files Created
1. `scripts/local_filter_pipeline.py` - Streaming extraction (working)
2. `scripts/generate_heavy_hitters.py` - Markdown generator (working, linting fixed)
3. `scripts/theme_classifier.py` - Ready for theme-based classification
4. `data/filtered_threads.json` - 1,363 threads extracted
5. `docs/heavy_hitters/` - 59 philosophical threads for review

### Technical Decisions
- **Streaming with ijson**: Prevents memory overflow on 37MB file
- **2-stage local filter**: Reduces 21,723 → 1,363 threads without API
- **Human-in-the-loop**: User defines themes from actual writing
- **Cost optimization**: $108 → $0 through smart filtering

### Discovered Patterns
- User writes substantial philosophical threads (500-1,159 words)
- Topics include: historical materialism, fascism analysis, COVID politics, Palestine
- Writing style: Academic, thorough, multi-tweet arguments
- Archive contains 42,774 words of philosophical content in heavy hitters alone

### Session Achievements
- Avoided catastrophic memory overflow with streaming
- Saved $100+ in API costs through local filtering
- Created human-centric classification system
- Fixed markdown linting issues (MD022, MD032) per user feedback

### Pending User Actions
1. Review `docs/heavy_hitters/` directory (59 files)
2. Fill out `THEME_TEMPLATE.md` with identified themes
3. Save as `THEMES_EXTRACTED.md`
4. Run `python scripts/theme_classifier.py` to process all threads

### Technical Context
- Python 3.12 environment
- Dependencies installed via uv/pip
- Twitter archive: 1.95GB total, 37MB tweets.js processed
- Output format: Markdown files with "smushed" text (concatenated tweets)

### Next Session Ready
- Load this memory to resume
- Check for THEMES_EXTRACTED.md
- Run classifier on all 1,363 threads
- Generate final markdown collection
- Configure MkDocs for deployment
