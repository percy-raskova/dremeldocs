# an absolutely DISGUSTING piece

In the wake of an absolutely DISGUSTING piece by the Baltimore Sun, I feel the need to explain to my non-Baltimore friends that Eddie Conway was an honest-to-goodness revolutionary. There is not much more I can say about his life and impact than was already explained in the obituary prepared by his comrades at Real News.

https://t.co/X4oxHI18oN I am filled with regret that I only got to meet him in person once. I was a brand-new teacher, and he was moderating a Real News forum on education in Baltimore. I gave an impassioned comment on the deep-seated structural roadblocks I could already see laid out before me. He came up to me afterwards and praised my passion and empathy for the students I barely knew.

He said "You know, you're going to be on national news."

I said "You think so?"

He said "I know so. You can't keep it inside." I wish I had the opportunity to work with him. I should have reached out to talk to him further. I should have worked with my union to establish a deeper working relationship with Real News Network.

Now he's gone. But there are plenty of other revolutionaries still here.
