# The vaccines

@JonMunitz The vaccines are extremely good at protecting you from severe infection, but not quite as good at preventing infection. Every infection is another opportunity for the virus to mutate and potentially evolve to evade immunity. If everyone's vaccinated, that is much less likely. @JonMunitz If fact, if the vaccines were *better* at curbing transmission, we wouldn't need to be as strict. The less effective at stopping community spread, the higher the percentage we need to keep the community safe.

Sorry I can't be as in-depth as I'd like in 280-character tweets ðŸ˜¬
