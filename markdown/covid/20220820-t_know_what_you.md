# t know what you

The most heartbreaking part of this whole situation is that the mass disability wrought by COVID is so invisible if you don't know what you're looking for. We're starting down the barrel of a society where tens of millions are just tired and confused all the time. They've all been told the pandemic is over. That COVID is basically a flu. So if they even notice themselves being weighed down by disability, they won't connect it to the 3, 5, 10 times they got infected. They'll just say "I guess I must be a lazy piece of shit." Scientists will take notice, of course. Just like we've been tracking this from the start, scientists will come out with paper after paper proving beyond a shadow of doubt what happened to us. How a decade of COVID crippled an entire society.

It will be this generation's lead.
