# Yeah, yeah, odious Zionist scum

Yeah, yeah, odious Zionist scum making transphobic death threats, whatever.

The thing I *actually* find notable here is the fact that the Israeli slur for trans people is "×§×•×§×¡×™× ×œ," taken from famous trans cabaret singer, Coccinelle, who visited Israel in the 60s. https://t.co/l2kTofJ4fo https://t.co/cu8xP0zQI3 It's kind of fitting that Israelis saw a trans woman for the first time ever, and *immediately* turned her name into a slur.

Compare that with Palestinian trans women, who use "ÙƒÙˆÙƒØ³ÙŠÙ†ÙŠÙ„" as an in-group term of camaraderie.

Just feels like a pertinent juxtaposition ðŸ¤”
