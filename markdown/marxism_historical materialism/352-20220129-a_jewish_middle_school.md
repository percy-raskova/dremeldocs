# a Jewish middle school

@RachelShukert When I was in a Jewish middle school, my class took part in a project called Shalshelet (Hebrew for chain), dedicated to interviewing and documenting the experiences of Holocaust survivors, so as not to break the chain of experience linking us to that tragedy. @RachelShukert We were warned that the second these people passed away, Holocaust denialism would rapidly ramp up because no one would be able to say "Actually, it happened to me." In my youthful naivety, I thought that was implausible: we have so much documentation! And yet, here we are.
