# the timeless struggle

It is deeply chauvinistic to erase the timeless struggle of oppressed people to educate themselves. Slaves teaching themselves to read under the cover of night. Women being beaten and arrested for sitting in at universities. Executions for being caught with subversive literature. https://t.co/wV9KrrcZJ7 https://t.co/SOzqQxoISK Billions of oppressed scholars, and you believe their heroic, harrowing quest for understanding is nothing compared to the simple elegance of quietly suffering under oppression. So noble. So savage.

Get real. We all deserve education. Some of us sacrifice more to get it.
