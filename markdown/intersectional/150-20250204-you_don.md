# You don

Notice how "You don't need to study theory" is the exclusive domain of those who *haven't* studied. When you study, you have the advantage of having experienced both states -- and knowing what it's like both with and without study, no one regrets the study. I have experienced both ignorance of Marxism and -- after years of study -- proficiency in Marxism. With the benefit of that firsthand experience, I choose the latter, hands down. The same is true of all the Marxists throughout history who have fought to liberate their people. The communists of oppressed nations who studied Marxism didn't regret their study. They fought imperialists by spreading both guns and literacy to their people. Suffering wasn't enough to liberate them -- it was simply what drove them to gather the tools to fight.

All the tools.
