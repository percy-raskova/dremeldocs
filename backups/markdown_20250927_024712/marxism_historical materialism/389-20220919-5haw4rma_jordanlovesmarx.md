# @5HAW4RMA @JordanLovesMarx

@5HAW4RMA @JordanLovesMarx If you actually think MAGA folks have revolutionary potential, then... do revolutionary stuff. Have structures in place to educate and politically develop "conservatives" that want to join up. Compromise on nothing and the hopeless ones will select themselves out. @5HAW4RMA @JordanLovesMarx Bigotry is inherently counter-revolutionary. The only people worth "converting" are the ones more committed to revolution than to counter-revolution. And you do that with... Revolution ðŸ¤· This isn't rocket science.
