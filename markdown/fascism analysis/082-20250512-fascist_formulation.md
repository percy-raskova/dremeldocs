# fascist formulation

When I say that something is a "fascist formulation" or "fascist mythology" etc., I'm not saying YOU are a fascist. I'm saying you've been taking certain "truths" as a given, and you need to recalibrate your thoughts process ASAP or you will never break past reactionary ideology. When you live in a society built on supremacist, eugenicist, eliminationist, and all-around regressive principles, a LOT more reaction filters into your thoughts than you assume. It's the ocean we swim in, and if you don't challenge it directly, you will be dragged under.
