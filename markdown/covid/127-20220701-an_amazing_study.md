# an amazing study

@FinchTH I just saw an amazing study that could *potentially* lead to a vaccine that actually prevents transmission among all potential variants. Even if that were to happen, I'd bet my life these vaxed and relaxed people will be like "Why would I bother getting another one??" @FinchTH Study finds that an antibody to a very highly conserved epitope inhibits membrane fusion, and has a strong prophylactic and therapeutic effect in vivo: https://t.co/Y5HX4dWA1c
