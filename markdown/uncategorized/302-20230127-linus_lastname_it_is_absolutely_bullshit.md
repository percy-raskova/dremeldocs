# @linus_lastname It is absolutely bullshit

@linus_lastname It is absolutely bullshit. It's impossible to give one specific timeline for disease progression. You could stop being contagious after a few days, or after a few weeks. You can be contagious with or without symptoms--or have symptoms long past contagiousness. @linus_lastname My advice is, IF you test positive on a rapid test, you should wait 5 days before taking another. Once you test negative by antigen, you're PROBABLY no longer contagious.

If you never test antigen positive in the first place, this doesn't apply.
