# act does two things once Obergefell is inevitably...

This act does two things once Obergefell is inevitably overturned:

1) Require states that ban gay marriage to recognize gay marriages performed in other states. (This will absolutely be overturned)

2) Preserves federal benefits for same sex couples (Mayyyybe will be overturned) https://t.co/1VEcVrp4Sx Anything they say should be "left up to states" is de facto not an actual right. They don't give a shit about you.
