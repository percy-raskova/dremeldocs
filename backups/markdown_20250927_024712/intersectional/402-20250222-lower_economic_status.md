# Lower economic status

Lower economic status correlates with *increased* pro-social behaviors and attitudes. Higher compassion for others' pain, more likely to help others at one's own expense, more attention paid to others' needs, more guilt for failing to help others, etc.

https://t.co/8JsKrHivKm https://t.co/d0lcHeypJa This persistent narrative that lower class people are just naturally more prone to chauvinism, and "Who could blame them when they're so stressed out???" is just utter nonsense. The worse off you are, the more value you tend to place on *collective* well-being. It's not the "woke left" that's condescending to the working classes -- it's the ones who baselessly believe these people must surely be cruel, selfish bigots. Those are *your* values, projected onto faceless masses you don't understand. I live in one of the poorest parts of Baltimore. My neighbors are largely the exact "poor, downtrodden wretches" you're picturing.

I'm a trans woman. My neighbors have by and large been nothing but respectful, sweet, and kind to me. We help each other.
