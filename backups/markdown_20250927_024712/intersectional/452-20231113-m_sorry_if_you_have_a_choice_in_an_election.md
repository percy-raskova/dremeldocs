I'm sorry if you have a choice in an election between 5 genocides or 6 genocides and you decide not to vote, you either have a child's view of politics or have ulterior motives and are evil https://t.co/tNt8Ogvlwf I view human suffering as a fungible token for political wrangling, because I am an ADULT. Unlike you children, who have the ulterior and/or evil motive of trying to actually fight back against suffering.
