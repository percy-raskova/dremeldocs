# t true, but I like to believe that when Lenin said 

This almost certainly isn't true, but I like to believe that when Lenin said "Trotsky has sent in a silly letter. We shall neither print it nor reply to him," he literally meant *silly*. Like, Trotsky sent Lenin a letter that wasn't meant to be serious at all. I can picture Lenin reading such a letter, giving a little smirk, and subsequently feeling the need to append that P.S. in his letter to Inessa Armand.
