# Revolutionaries are in the streets, in prisons, in trap...

Revolutionaries are in the streets, in prisons, in trap houses, in shanty towns, in ghettos, in reservations, talking with gangs, vagrants, dealers, prostitutes, fugitives, migrants.

We are everywhere. If that makes you queasy, steel your lily white stomachs and do it anyway. If you're serious about revolution, there WILL come a time when you become just as criminalized and relentlessly pursued as all the rest. When that time arrives, you will be grateful to already have your people arrayed around you. You do not want to go to prison alone. You do not want to squat in crumbling houses alone. You do not want to trek through the wilderness alone. And the people who do these things already are closer than you to rising up to break their shackles.
