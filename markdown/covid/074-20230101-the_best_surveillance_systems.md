# the best surveillance systems

@matrixgoth For much of the pandemic, South Africa has had among the best surveillance systems for tracking new variants. They *found* delta and omicron before anyone else, but those variants were already circulating worldwide by the time they did. @matrixgoth Based on the molecular clock, it does seem likely that beta actually *did* evolve from among the genomes that had previously been prevalent in SA, but also... who cares? How many other variants quietly evolved out of the giant petri dish of unmitigated growth that is the U.S.?
