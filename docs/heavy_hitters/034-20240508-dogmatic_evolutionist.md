The reason Marxists seem "dogmatic" to liberals is because we present ourselves with the confidence of those whose theories are empirically demonstrated. The same way a creationist would view me as a "dogmatic evolutionist," simply because I won't change my mind on a proven fact. To them, having an ideology is seen as almost *sinful*. They throw it around as a slur: "Oh, you can't trust them... they're ~ideological~!!! üò±"

They fail to recognize liberalism as an ideology; it's just "common sense." Just like creationism was once "common sense." But the theory of evolution has been born out in the real world, time and time again. Every biological phenomenon is explained much better through the model of evolution than the model of creation. Evolution as a theoretical framework is able to correctly predict natural events. Liberalism is dogmatic. It mystifies phenomena and naturalizes the existing state of affairs as eternal, immutable, and causeless. History, to a liberal, is a list of bullet points: events in a sequence, with no underlying reason beyond "that's how it happened to play out." At best, they acknowledge factual events, like a moving object occupying multiple distinct positions over time. They fail to accurately predict changes in velocity, because they don't believe in forces, let alone understand what those forces are, or how they change. At worst, they come up with false descriptions of the object's past positions, extrapolated backwards to fit their faulty model. They instinctively believe "researchers" who fabricate data for ideological purposes, because they don't believe liberalism can even *be* ideological. A theoretical model like Marxism is dogmatism to them, because it does not "accurately" predict the falsehoods they believe because of *their* dogmatism.

So we arrive at an impasse, where they cannot conceive of needing to update their worldview -- because of their worldview! When we assert that these falsehoods are false, we are not just presenting new data for them to investigate: to a liberal, we are committing a grievous sin. The claims cannot be investigated, because the falsehoods are already a matter of dogmatic certainty. The sad truth is that it is largely impossible to "convince" anyone to let go of liberalism. It can only be demonstrated, and the results will only be accepted by those willing to accept them. Those people are, by and large, those who are the most disadvantaged by capitalism. Class instincts are not an impenetrable wall, and people CAN unlearn dogmatism -- even dogmatic allegiance to a system that materially positions them higher than others. But the more secure your economic position, the less likely you are to even entertain dissent. Evolution did not come to be largely accepted as fact through debates with creationists. Bishops who once ostracized biologists did not shake off their vestments because someone spoke the incontrovertible truth to them: their power rested on the persistence of the lie. But over the decades, more and more people were brought up in a world where evolution was constantly demonstrating its value over the immaterial vagaries of creationism. Very few were "converted," so much as they were prevented from becoming entrenched in dogmatism to begin with. Despite the impression you get from watching the machinery of bourgeois hegemony at work -- the media, the intelligentsia, the politicians, the propaganda -- the vast majority of people are NOT dogmatic liberals. They are simply moving through a liberal world, trying to survive. As it gets harder and harder for more and more people to survive, the predictive, practically applicable power of Marxism becomes more and more appealing. It is the duty of those who have already begun to study to both continue to research and to teach others to do so as well. Liberal dogma is dying. It is failing to provide the answers people seek. Now is the time of Marxist science.
