# irreconcilable differences

There are irreconcilable differences between my leftism and other philosophies. I simply don't care.

If you're not actively undermining me, I don't really care what you do. I think my theory is more able to actually win. If I'm right, I hope you'll join us once we start winning. If your "leftism" consists of viewing the half-dozen social democrats in office as your primary enemies, you are even more useless than they are. Ignore them. Organize beyond the state and make them irrelevant.
