# US socialists

This song should be the benchmark for US socialists interacting with Cuba. The shared joy in the struggle against imperialism. The unvarnished humanity. How far we've come. Solidaridad.

Mírala que linda viene
Mírala que linda va
La revolución cubana
Que llego y no se va más https://t.co/yO6lj9Yy86 Credit to @GETchan_YouTube for the incredible archival work, putting together this and other excellent videos that carry the story of global revolution, as it was, is, and will be ✊
