# US refuses to even sign onto a nonbinding resolution...

@babadookspinoza The US refuses to even sign onto a nonbinding resolution affirming that food is a human right. Or that Nazis are bad. @babadookspinoza (My phone tried to autocorrect "nonbinding" to "nonbinary," and I'm sure the US would also refuse to sign onto a nonbinary resolution.)
