# DremelDocs: A Revolutionary Archive

## The Material Base of This Collection

This archive contains **1,363 threads** documenting over a decade of revolutionary theoretical work. Not "carefully curated" in some liberal sense of respectability politics, but *organized according to the material conditions of our struggle*. Each thread represents an intervention in the class war of ideas - applying historical materialist analysis to the concrete conditions we face under late capitalism, settler colonialism, and imperial hegemony.

## Navigate by Revolutionary Framework

### [Revolutionary Theory](/themes/)
The theoretical apparatus: Marxism, historical materialism, dialectical method, political economy. Not as academic exercises but as *weapons* for understanding and transforming our conditions. Theory that emerges from and returns to struggle.

### [Critical Analysis](/analysis/)
Systematic examination of fascism, cultural hegemony, and the political economy of public health. Every analysis grounded in the material base - who benefits, who is harmed, what class forces are at work. No idealist speculation, only materialist investigation.

### [Applied Theory](/intersectional/)
The concrete application of revolutionary theory to all forms of oppression. Not liberal "intersectionality" that treats oppressions as separate systems to be added together, but dialectical analysis revealing how gender oppression, racism, ableism, and queer oppression are *produced by and reproduce* capitalist social relations.

### [Resources](/tags/)
Complete tagging system for militants, organizers, and serious students of revolution. Because institutional memory is revolutionary infrastructure.

## On AI as Revolutionary Tool: A Political Statement

### Persephone Raskova and the Seizure of Computational Means

Let me be *absolutely clear* about what happened here: My partner Persephone Raskova built this entire archive using generative AI tools. Not despite being a revolutionary, but *because* she is one.

While liberals wring their hands about "AI ethics" and tech accelerationists worship at the altar of AGI, Persephone demonstrated something far more important: **These tools can be weapons in the hands of the working class.**

She took Claude, ChatGPT, and local language models - tools built by capital to optimize exploitation - and turned them toward revolutionary purposes. Every classification algorithm, every extraction script, every line of code was written through systematic collaboration with AI. Not to replace human judgment but to *amplify revolutionary capacity*.

This is what it looks like to seize the means of computational production. Not waiting for some reformed "ethical AI" that will never come under capitalism. Not rejecting these tools and leaving them solely in the hands of capital. But *taking what exists and wielding it for liberation*.

### The Material Reality of AI Under Capitalism

Of course these models are trained on stolen labor. Of course they reproduce bourgeois ideology. Of course they're owned by capital and designed for profit extraction. *That's exactly the point.*

Every tool under capitalism bears the stamp of its class origins. The printing press was invented to reproduce religious authority. The internet was built for military command. But in the hands of revolutionaries, these same tools become weapons against the system that created them.

Persephone spent hundreds of hours teaching these models to recognize revolutionary vocabulary, to classify by materialist categories rather than liberal ones, to preserve theoretical rigor while organizing vast archives. She didn't accept their bourgeois defaults - she *struggled* with them, forced them to serve revolutionary purposes.

### Beyond Liberal Hand-Wringing

The liberal response to AI oscillates between technophobic pearl-clutching and reformist fantasies about "democratizing" AI. Both miss the point entirely.

We don't need "more ethical" exploitation machines. We don't need "inclusive" surveillance apparatus. We need to take these tools - *right now, as they exist* - and use them to build revolutionary capacity.

This archive proves it's possible. Built with zero corporate APIs, zero surveillance integration, zero compromise with platform capitalism. Just a revolutionary using AI to transform 21,723 scattered tweets into organized, searchable, preservable revolutionary theory.

## Preservation as Revolutionary Infrastructure

### Against Platform Dependency

Twitter is dying. Not metaphorically - *materially*. Servers failing, engineers fleeing, infrastructure crumbling under the weight of one billionaire's ego. And when it falls, they want our theoretical work to disappear with it.

This archive ensures that *cannot happen*. Every thread, every analysis, every intervention in the discourse - preserved outside their collapsing platforms, organized by our categories, serving our purposes.

### The Technology of Liberation

- **Local-first processing**: No corporate APIs, no cloud surveillance, no dependency on capital's infrastructure
- **Static generation**: These files will outlive every platform, every database, every proprietary system
- **Accessible design**: WCAG compliance because revolutionary theory must reach everyone capital disables
- **Full-text search**: Because finding the right theoretical tool quickly can make the difference in struggle
- **Mobile access**: Because not everyone has a desktop, but everyone needs access to revolutionary theory

## Recent Theoretical Interventions

### Revolutionary Optimism and Materialist Hope
*Extended analysis* · Revolutionary Theory

> Not the false optimism of reformists who promise the system can be fixed, but the *material* optimism that emerges from understanding capitalism's contradictions make its overthrow both necessary and possible. Gramsci's "pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will" situated in concrete conditions of 21st century struggle.

### Capital and the Production of Subjectivity
*Critical analysis* · Political Economy

> How capitalist social relations don't just exploit our labor but shape the very categories through which we understand ourselves. The bourgeois subject isn't natural - it's *produced*. And what capital produces, revolution can transform.

### Liberation Politics and Class Analysis
*Applied theory* · Intersectional Analysis

> Against both class reductionism and liberal identity politics. A demonstration of how every liberation struggle under capitalism necessarily becomes a struggle against capital itself. Not because we impose that framework, but because capital imposes itself on every aspect of life.

*This archive exists because revolution requires memory, theory requires preservation, and the working class requires its own infrastructure. Built with AI turned against its masters. Maintained for the movement that will bury capitalism.*

*The system is working exactly as intended. Our task is not to fix it but to destroy it and build something genuinely human in its place.*
