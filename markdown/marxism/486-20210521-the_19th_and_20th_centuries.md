# the 19th and 20th centuries

It's kind of a cool coincidence that every hero of the 19th and 20th centuries was a leftist.

Lincoln? Friends with Marx.

MLK? “The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and evils of racism.”

Einstein? Literally wrote "Why Socialism?" Also coincidentally, every villain happened to be a capitalist.

Hitler felt traditional capitalism was *too forgiving* of weakness, and genocide was needed to help it along.

Herzl saw Palestinians and poor people as needing to be driven out through economic displacement. Give me literally any of the heroes or villains we learn about in school from that time period, and their level of decency can be mapped pretty plainly to their perception of the class struggle.
