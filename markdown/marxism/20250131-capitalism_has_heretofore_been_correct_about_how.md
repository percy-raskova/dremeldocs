# Capitalism HAS heretofore been correct... about how to...

Capitalism HAS heretofore been correct... about how to build capitalism.

And more specifically there were a LOT of capitalist thinkers who tried and fail to implement their vision. Their ideology was therefore wrong. https://t.co/hfpTcVR9uC There are also a number of mutually opposed ideologies of how to maintain and advance capitalism in the modern world. We are watching in real time as one strain is overtaking the one that became hegemonic following WWII. As conditions change, the definition of "correct" does too. Biological evolution works this way as well. "Fitness" is a dialectical phenomenon. As species evolve to fit their environments, their environments change -- both due to geological shifts and more crucially, due to the activities of the organisms as *they* change. Getting bigger, stronger, faster, etc. is not necessarily "getting fitter." The "correct" evolutionary strategy is whatever works best for the environment you're in and what you have to work with. And that will change. Unlike with biological evolution though, we are able to rigorously study our environment, our history, and our options, then *plan* our strategy. We aren't tossed around by the whims of inscrutable forces and passive evolution. But we're still restricted by what is possible. Success means analyzing what's possible and then actually doing it. You can't strike a stone and expect water to pour from it, but you can use those stones to craft tools to dig a well. Especially if you don't call wells heretical and denounce those who have built them.
