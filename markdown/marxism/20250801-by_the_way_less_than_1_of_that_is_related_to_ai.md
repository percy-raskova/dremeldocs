# By the way, less than 1% of that is related to AI use

By the way, less than 1% of that is related to AI use.

The obsessive hatred people attach to AI is little more than a way to absolve themselves of the astronomical environmental damage caused by everyday consumption patterns. https://t.co/ooQBCn7mkD Environmental destruction is systematic and structural, an accumulating apocalypse driven by the entire economic system. Liberals focus on individual consumption tweaks ("don't use AI!" "drive an electric car!") while erasing the vast impact on their *collective* lifestyles. The food you eat, the home you live in, the utilities, the consumer goods, medical care, education, transportation, *everything* comes together into an environmental footprint 100 TIMES that of the bottom 10%.

You can dedicate your life to those tweaks and barely make a dent. The rise of AI only widens that imbalance to an imperceptible degree. A fraction of a fraction of the grotesque scale of ecocide waged on behalf of the global top 10%.

https://t.co/EyaDDtgZ21 There is only one solution to this hellish situation: imperial class suicide in service to a decolonial revolution that abolishes this planet-destroying mode of production.

Your little petty bourgeois crusades against "dirty consumption" serve no purpose but obfuscation.
