# s exactly what I mean by 

@kILLtheeBoer Yes, that's exactly what I mean by "learning to do it." It's not obvious, and we need a robust intelligence apparatus to direct these actions. Where are shipments scheduled, what is the cargo, what is the destination, what imperial repression can be arrayed against us, etc. @kILLtheeBoer It can't be conjured out of thin air. But it also needs to be fast and dynamic, while simultaneously planning for both the many emerging contingencies as well as the conditions for success. Tacoma had none of these things. People showed up, stood around, and left.
