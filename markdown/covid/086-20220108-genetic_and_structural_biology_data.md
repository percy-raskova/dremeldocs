# genetic and structural biology data

@hjelle_brian @genjibear There's a lot of genetic and structural biology data showing potential mutations that can give rise to variants of concern. That's why I was ringing the alarm on omicron the second we got the full sequence: we already knew what those mutations could do to antibody interactions. @hjelle_brian @genjibear I'm not saying we could fit *every possible variant* into one vaccine. But in my eyes, a huge advantage of mRNA vaccines is how easy a "spray and pray" approach could be. You know, if we could actually convince people to keep coming back for a bunch of boosters ðŸ¤·
