# all these people

8:24: "We gotta hold all these people harmless. We can't do like Trump is doing, where he's saying... Oh. You're gonna tell me..." 8:34: "A woman comes here, and is being beaten by her husband, she shouldn't be afraid just because she's an undocumented." 8:41: "You gonna get rid of your 9 super PACs?"

Bernie: "I don't have any super PACs!"

Biden: "You do! You want me to list 'em?"

Bernie: "Yes, please, list em!"

Biden: "... Ah, come on."
