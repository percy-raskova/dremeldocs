# Practice makes perfect

"Practice makes perfect" is only true if you practice *correctly*. No matter how much effort you put into improving, if you're doing it wrong, you're actually just training bad habits. You need to follow a regiment that actually leads to the results you want. In the absence of a pre-established procedure, you need to figure it out from scratch. That requires an iterative process of experimentation, followed by deep analysis, followed by updating your procedure, followed by novel experimentation.

In other words... science. This is especially true for the practice of bringing about change in a deeply-broken society. We can see clearly that, whatever we're doing, it's not working. Many people keep plugging away, trying to change things, but change never arrives. We are practicing incorrectly. In the imperial core, there is a total lack of scientific investigation into the practice of creating change. There are many reasons for this, but the primary one is that we have been indoctrinated into liberalism, which purports to already *have* the proper procedure for change. But we can clearly see that the procedure we have been handed doesn't work--because it hasn't actually changed anything. When we practice within the liberal framework, we are practicing incorrectly. We are not improving our practice; only further entrenching bad habits. Luckily, we don't have to start over from scratch. Plenty of movements in the past have successfully brought about change. We can investigate what they did and begin our experimentation with adapted protocols. But that requires first acknowledging the need for experimentation.
