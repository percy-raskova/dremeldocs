# just a silly little vibes-based tweet

@LMillzEsq To be frank, this was just a silly little vibes-based tweet, but it is rooted in actual theory. I intend to expound on it in the book I'm writing, but what I'm seeing others comment is part of the answer -- needing to specify ethicalness reifies monogamy as "naturally ethical". @LMillzEsq Do you practice ethical apple eating? Or even bother to specify that you eat apples in any context *other* than if apples come up?

In "queer culture" (a nebulous term), someone might mention "my partners [X] and [Y]..." as casually as you might say "this apple I was eating..."
