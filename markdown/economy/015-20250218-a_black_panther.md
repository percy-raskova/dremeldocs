# a Black Panther

Have you ever even met a Black Panther? I like to imagine you'd at least have the decency to not disrespect their espoused political ideology directly to their faces. They explicitly rejected anarchism, and you don't get to claim them if you can't see that. https://t.co/DpHOKyPZm5 Balagoon and Ervin both *became* anarchists and *left* the party. Because, again, the party was not a home for anarchists.
