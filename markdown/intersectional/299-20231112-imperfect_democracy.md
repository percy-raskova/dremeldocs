# imperfect democracy

Weird how this "imperfect democracy" seems to be constantly on the precipice of utter destruction -- and yet somehow never reaches that point of no longer being a democracy.

Serious question: what *specifically* would it take to believe we are not in a democracy? https://t.co/aj7xKgwzeV Is our "imperfect democracy" safe forever? I don't think liberals *actually* believe that, which means there must be a specific set of criteria for when we can say "Nope, this isn't a democracy anymore." They are constantly saying "Democracy is in danger," so what is the danger? If we look at liberalism's favorite method of flexing democratic will -- the ballot -- we have to acknowledge that their hated "authoritarian regimes," like Cuba, China, and North Korea, all have elections.

"But those aren't actually free and fair elections!"

Aren't they? How are you making the determination of whether an election is "real"? Again, we need to be specific here. We have AMPLE evidence that public opinion in "democracies" has literally no impact on policy. Whatever our votes are doing, they sure aren't enforcing democratic will. Is that the "imperfect" part of our imperfect democracy? That, no matter what we want, it doesn't happen through the ballot box? Or is there a distinct, measurable difference between OUR ineffectual votes and the votes cast in "authoritarian" countries? I'm not being antagonistic here: I'm actually asking. What specific things can change about our society that would tip it over into "not a democracy" anymore? And why do you think we aren't already there? Alternatively, we're not an "imperfect democracy" at all, and never have been, and have always just been a genocidal, imperialist, bourgeois, settler colonial enterprise. With some voting sprinkled in for funsies.
