# My ideology is inflexible *because* it is based on facts

My ideology is inflexible *because* it is based on facts. Any new facts I learn simply *add* to my understanding.

The advantage of having an ideology focused on material reality is that there is literally no way for it to be contraindicated by exposure to more reality. https://t.co/bpmT4PR2cM Contrast that with a man who gets bombarded with people explaining why prison abolition is necessary, refuses to learn anything, then responds with impotent blubbering about how everyone ELSE is so rigid in their beliefs.
