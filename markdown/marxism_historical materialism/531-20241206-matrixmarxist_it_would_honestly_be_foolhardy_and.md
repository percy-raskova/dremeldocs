# @matrixmarxist It would honestly be foolhardy and hubristic...

@matrixmarxist It would honestly be foolhardy and hubristic of me to even speculate on the shape of things to come. It is completely tied to the way things shake out over the course of revolution, and there will surely be many transitional forms along the way. @matrixmarxist I envision along the way, one of the more enduring states will be a federation of liberated nations across North America, working in unison to eliminate the vestiges of capital and empire and bourgeois culture (while also defending against wherever the fascists flee to next). @matrixmarxist And no, that obviously does not include mass forced displacement of white people to "send them back where they came from" or whatever. It *does* include mass exodus of those who choose to throw in their lot with the fascist regime.

(And also the eradication of the suburbs.)
