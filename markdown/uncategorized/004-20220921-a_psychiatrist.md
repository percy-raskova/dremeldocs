# a psychiatrist

@Rocko64_ This is the way it's always worked with me. When I did end up seeing a psychiatrist, I told her "All I want is antidepressants. The mania doesn't really have much impact."

I ended up also getting a prescription for a mood stabilizer as a back up if mania gets to be too much. @Rocko64_ Everyone is different. Do NOT take my example as gospel. Talk to a psychiatrist, fine tune your medication to your own needs. It took a long time to get the proper SSRI dosage that worked for me, and I ended up not ever needing the antipsychotic (but I still have it around).
