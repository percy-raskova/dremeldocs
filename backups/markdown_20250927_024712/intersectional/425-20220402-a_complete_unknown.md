# a complete unknown

For those asking why anyone would vote against unionizing:

- Most people have never been in a union, so you're asking them to take a chance on a complete unknown.

- People are loss-averse, and weigh the potential to lose what they have more heavily than potential gains. - The employer spends huge amounts of time and money reaching *every single worker* multiple times. They have everyone's contact info, and can hold everyone's jobs hostage. Union organizers have to struggle to reach people they've never met. - Workers can't be expected to just "do their own research" and figure out the importance of unions, because there's a ton of anti-union propaganda they have to sift through.

- The broader culture is suffused with anti-union tropes that often outweigh pro-union sentiment. - The employer often heavily implies that if there was a union, they'd "be forced" to shut down. This is not an idle threat: work sites *have* been closed to crush unions.

Union organizing is an enormous uphill battle against legitimate fear and the cultural hegemony of capital.
