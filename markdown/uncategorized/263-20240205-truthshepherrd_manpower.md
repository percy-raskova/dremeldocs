# @TruthShepherrd Manpower

@TruthShepherrd Manpower? They spent literal decades painstakingly building these structures, and tens or sometimes hundreds of thousands of people.

As far as the size of the Earth, I'm not sure what that has to do with what we were talking about. It was calculated by Eratosthenes ~2.2k y.a. @TruthShepherrd It was pretty simple: measure the length of shadows cast at the same time at different locations, then calculate based on the difference the arc length of the Earth's sphere. Even with ancient timekeeping and distance measuring tools, he got it to a remarkably close accuracy.
