# re seeing was already true of the original strain: for...

@jrsherrod @t_NYC It's still COVID-19. A lot of the "new" information we're seeing was already true of the original strain: for example, they're only now acknowledging that viral aerosol can linger in the air and still be infectious, which is something scientists have warned about for 2 years. @jrsherrod @t_NYC That said, yes it definitely does have a different profile as far as infection. Not just evading prior adaptive immunity, but also something as fundamental as the way it enters cells. It shouldn't be surprising that there are different disease outcomes and timelines.
