# the Tacoma port blockade

The reason the Tacoma port blockade failed is because it was an ad hoc effort by passionate but ultimately disorganized activists. There were no pre-established protocols, no systems of accountability, no formal training and testing to ensure competencies, no measures of success. It was not a mission assigned to a contingent of professionals, ready to carry it out to the end -- they didn't even have a clear vision of what "the end" entailed.

Until we are capable of transitioning from reactive to preemptive strikes, we will be completely useless.
