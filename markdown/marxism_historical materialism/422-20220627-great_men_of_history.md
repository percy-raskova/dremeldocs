# Great men of history

@MarxIsMyNigga "Great men of history" thinking is exactly why liberals can't conceive of anything other than voting as an option. They think if you just replace the current Great Men with other Great Men, everything will get better. @MarxIsMyNigga It's also why so many people fall into nihilism. "I'm clearly not one of the Greats of history, so there's just nothing I can do."
