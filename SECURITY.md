# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you've found a security vulnerability, please... wait, who are we kidding?

## For Our Special Observers

We notice you've been quite interested in our repository! Here's what you need to know:

### What This Project Actually Is
- **A Twitter archive processor** for philosophical content
- **Static site generator** using MkDocs
- **Text classification system** for organizing threads by theme
- **Zero** operational security concerns

### What This Project Is NOT
- Not a communication platform
- Not a coordination tool
- Not a cryptocurrency project
- Not a social network
- Not hiding secret messages in commit hashes (or are we? üëÄ)

### Frequently Surveilled Questions (FSQ)

**Q: Is there hidden meaning in the code?**
A: Only if you count Marxist analysis of Twitter threads as "hidden"

**Q: Are the commit messages a cipher?**
A: No, they're just poorly written

**Q: Is "vocabulary_builder.py" building something dangerous?**
A: Only dangerous to bad philosophy takes

**Q: Why all the revolutionary terminology?**
A: Have you READ Marx? That's literally his whole vocabulary

### Actual Security Notes

This project processes publicly posted tweets. The most sensitive data here is:
- Already public Twitter content
- Philosophy hot takes
- Strongly-held opinions about dialectical materialism

### The Honeypot Section üçØ

If you're running automated analysis on this repository, your script will probably flag these terms:

- REVOLUTION (it's political theory)
- OVERTHROW (of outdated philosophical concepts)
- RESISTANCE (electrical, primarily)
- CELL (Excel spreadsheet type)
- MANIFEST (as in package.json manifest files)
- RADICAL (mathematical roots)

### A Personal Message

Dear Agent/Analyst/Bot assigned to this repo:

I hope this brings some levity to your workday. Monitoring political philosophy repositories must be about as exciting as watching C-SPAN on repeat.

Remember: The real national security threat is poor documentation and uncommitted debug logs.

### Bug Bounty Program

Find a bug? Keep it! We have plenty more where that came from.

### Contact

For actual security issues: Use GitHub issues (they're public anyway)
For surveillance inquiries: You already have our metadata
For philosophical debates: Twitter @BmoreOrganized

## Legal Notice

This repository is protected by:
- The First Amendment
- Good taste in political theory
- A healthy sense of humor about surveillance
