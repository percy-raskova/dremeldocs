# s hilarious how the three main attitudes toward Trump are...

I think it's hilarious how the three main attitudes toward Trump are basically:

"Trump is gonna save America! ðŸ¥°"

"Trump is gonna destroy America! ðŸ˜­"

"Trump is gonna destroy America! ðŸ¥°"

None of these is really correct. Trump is *intensifying* America. Trump's mission is to make America even more America than ever. In that sense, he's "saving" America -- just not the America liberals want to believe in.

He is destroying the veneer of a progressive, pluralistic America that never truly existed outside the minds of idealists. And of course, by intensifying it, he is also inadvertently *driving* its destruction. Like a starving man gobbling up his remaining supplies even faster, eating tainted food, getting into fights for more scraps. The more desperate, violent, and risky he gets, the faster he dies. For an empire, built on exploitation and rabid consumption, eating is destroying. There is no way for the US to grow or even maintain itself sustainably. Its very nature is to feast. All Trump is doing is trying to feed it more quickly and brutally. Trump is not destroying America. He is widening the maw of empire to swallow the world, exposing the vulnerable, fleshy innards past the dripping fangs. He's making it more vital than ever for the targets of America's brutality to destroy it.
