# s a very worrying trend of people essentially claiming that...

There's a very worrying trend of people essentially claiming that we can't actually know anything, that science is unreliable, that scientists and a mysterious "They" are lying to you, and that essentially any alternative theory is equally valid to "mainstream science." They even present their theories as being *more* valid, since their integrity isn't tainted by being pushed by "Them". The theories are being "repressed", presumably for nefarious political purposes -- and why would "They" repress something unless it was true?
