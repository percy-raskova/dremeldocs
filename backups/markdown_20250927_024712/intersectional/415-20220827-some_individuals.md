# some individuals

@theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon Capitalism and socialism are terms describing modes of production:

Capitalism is when some individuals privately own the land, tools, and raw materials needed to produce stuff, and other individuals use those privately-owned means to do the production in exchange for a wage. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon Socialism, by contrast, is a mode of production in which those means of production are *not* in private hands. Instead, the state owns the means of production. Instead of relying on a wage to survive, the workers receive what they need directly from the state. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon The difference between the two is not in the benefits of employment, nor in the degree to which workers' living conditions are bolstered by state taxation. Rather it is in the extent to which private ownership and profit motive dictate production. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon A state which regulates and taxes private enterprise to improve working and living conditions is simply holding back the worst excesses of capitalism while maintaining the core power dynamic. This is a practical concern in a number of ways, not just a moral one. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon The first is that this maintains a system in which production is organized around that which generates the most profit, not the most social good. If the capitalist determines that he can get more profit off an inferior product, he will oblige his workers to create subpar goods. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon If it is more profitable to use environmentally destructive practices, capitalism enforces that destruction. A regulatory state may attempt to temper that... but then it just becomes profitable to influence public perception and buy off governments. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon That leads into the second main problem with maintaining capitalism under social democracy: the social gains are ephemeral. By allowing capitalists to continue holding their economic and social power, you are giving them free reign to use that power to undo social democracy. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon We see this in those precious European societies which instituted social democratic reforms in the past, but which have since seen those efforts undone by "pragmatic" and "level-headed" neoliberals. Those politicians rose to power on the backs of capitalist support.
