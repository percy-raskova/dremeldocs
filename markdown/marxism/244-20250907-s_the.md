Hey, what's the "la" part of "larp" stand for?

People have been using that word incorrectly for so long that they've forgotten that dressing up and running around is literally the core premise. https://t.co/bkMt4X2aPm https://t.co/i7gIW4WSTu Posting boastfully on Twitter? Not a larp. That's just good old fashioned rp.

Filming a video of sheltered, suburban, petty bourgeois white dudes learning for the very first time how a tape measure works? Now THAT'S a larp.
