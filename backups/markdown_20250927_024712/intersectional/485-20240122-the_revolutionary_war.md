# the revolutionary war

Even while still embroiled in the revolutionary war against the forces of reaction, the nascent Soviets were constantly checking and double-checking its progress. This letter by Lenin, issued a mere month after the formation of the USSR, was his recommendation for how to improve. https://t.co/vFALqyWWxr He proposed updating the very institution put in charge of assessing the work of the state, folding it into the decision-making body itself, increasing its membership by recruiting more workers and peasants, increasing the frequency of its meetings, and ensuring accountability. It's not some devastating gotcha to point out that Marxism-Leninism is a scientific pursuit that constantly works to improve itself based on real-world experience and the hard work of deliberate planning. We aren't utopians: we don't pretend destroying the old order is easy.
