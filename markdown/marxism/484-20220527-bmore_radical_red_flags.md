# @bmore_radical Red flags

@bmore_radical Red flags:

- Poverty
- Membership in left-wing orgs
- Black, in whatever circuitous way they can justify
- Immigrant
- Social media posts expressing even tepid resistance to capitalism

Not red flags:

- Fascism @bmore_radical "Wait, why was this person not excluded from gun ownership? He's a member of racist chat rooms!"

"Well yeah, but we can't count *that*, otherwise we'd have to fire our entire police force."
