# oppressed people

Every time a trot opens their mouth to talk about oppressed people, it makes the argument against their regressive, useless, chauvinist ideology ever more salient. Grow up, stop opposing every material manifestation of liberation, maybe someday you'll be part of a real movement. If you take anything away from the heroic success of the Vietnamese communists other than adulation and bottomless respect, you are my enemy. They did what you are too impotent to do and you resent them for actually managing to wrest their home from the grip of empire.
