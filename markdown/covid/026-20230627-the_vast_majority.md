# the vast majority

@BoobyJargon First of all, the vast majority of health agencies have rescinded guidelines requiring hospitals to report COVID cases or deaths.

Second, deaths continue to remain ~20% higher than expected based on pre-pandemic conditions. COVID impacts health long past the acute phase. https://t.co/fu4RtbJdav @BoobyJargon If you want to say "the pandemic is over, but COVID is still here," you have to reckon with the massive amount of long-term damage COVID wreaks on populations at scale. Our baseline of health has plummeted. This is not a sustainable position for society to be in.
