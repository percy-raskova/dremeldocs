# m seeing a concerning amount of mythologizing about Al-Aqsa...

I'm seeing a concerning amount of mythologizing about Al-Aqsa Flood as being emblematic of the power of vague notions of "autonomous organizing." The interpretation of this wave of resistance as somehow emerging "organically" out of anarchic struggle is deeply flawed. This is the most successful Palestinian resistance operation in living memory, precisely because of the depth of organization and regimentation involved. This has been carefully built for *years*, ramping up in the past year to execute a centrally-planned offensive. Numerous factions, each with their own political bent, have been working in concert since 2020. Under the organization of the Joint Operations Room, they have trained together, strategized together, and stayed in constant communication throughout the operation. They have built supply chains, intelligence networks, and communications infrastructure, while carefully plotting a campaign to disrupt each of these crucial components of the occupying forces. The result has been borne out in their ability to seize and hold territory. This is like nothing Israel has seen since 1973, where it faced several states with standing militaries. Because the Palestinian resistance has made itself a fully formed military in its own right, Israel has no idea how to face them. They are 50 years out of practice.
