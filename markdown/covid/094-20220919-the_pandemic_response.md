# the pandemic response

It's honestly hard to imagine how the pandemic response could possibly be that much worse under Trump.

The only policy difference I can think of is that he probably wouldn't have sent out that WHOPPING 12 free rapid tests (per household) (if you specifically request them). More significantly, he probably would have cancelled the free PCR testing (you know, that option fewer and fewer people avail themselves of).

He would have taken credit for the vaccines and of course continued to pay giant corporations to distribute them. He would have done the exact same thing Biden did, telling everyone that masks are pointless now, once you're vaccinated. It's possible MORE conservatives would have gotten vaccinated under Trump, and probably the same number of liberals. We might even have seen "resistance liberals" continue to wear masks for a while just to spite him, rather than immediately going back to brunch.

But all in all, the approach of pretending we're done--and the horrific outcomes of that approach--would be pretty similar.
