# stuff *beyond* survival

@OdessaCubbage @yeongno3 The point is that even if *all* of your labor goes toward "unnecessary" things, you can still be producing stuff *beyond* survival--as long as reproductive labor is still going on in society! @OdessaCubbage @yeongno3 In a two-person society, with one producing enough food for both and one producing enough coffee for both, and where those goods are shared freely, both are performing productive labor. The farmer produces extra food and supports the productive coffee labor.
