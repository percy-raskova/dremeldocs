# @HScorching @chenweihua

@HScorching @chenweihua You wanna talk about debt traps? How about during "decolonization," when former colonies were told they now had to pay off billions in contracts that were imposed upon them by EU colonial powers? For decades, they've been forced to spend more on debt than on social programs. @HScorching @chenweihua This paradigm forced nations to rely on IMF loans to help pay this false debt. These loans are conditioned on governments privatizing, deregulating, and cutting social programs. Western powers have been usurping African sovereignty for decades, even after supposedly decolonizing. @HScorching @chenweihua They have orchestrated the overthrow of any leaders attempting to build self-sufficiency for their people. For the "crime" of rejecting IMF "aid," France coordinated the assassination of Thomas Sankara and his replacement with Compaor√©, who immediately went back to the IMF.
