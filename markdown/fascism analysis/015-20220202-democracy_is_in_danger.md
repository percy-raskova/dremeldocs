# democracy is in danger

@hjelle_brian What causes me no end of frustration is that Democrats seem to have some vague inkling that "democracy is in danger" without any real grasping of what that danger *really* means or how to avert the danger. @hjelle_brian If your proposed solution to creeping fascism is "Just vote harder!" you are a fool who has clearly failed every history course you've ever been in.

That, or you're an oligarch who thinks you'll be spared, and who cares about The Plebs?
