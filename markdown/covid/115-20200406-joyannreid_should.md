# @JoyAnnReid "Should"

@JoyAnnReid "Should"? No.

There is a very good reason why we *do* still do it, which is that no one in power is ever going to change the system that brought them to power. Mail-in voting would make it so easy for ordinary people to vote that they might vote for someone new. @JoyAnnReid You can help change this! Use your platform to publicly call for electoral reform. Help people understand the reasons why the system is the way it is!
