# purchasing decisions

@CaniTerrae The US military also makes purchasing decisions based not on need or effectiveness, but on profit for arms manufacturers, thanks to sweetheart contracts and the revolving door of lobbying. A trillion dollar annual budget doesn't really mean a trillion dollars worth of power. @CaniTerrae Not that the US military is *weak* by any stretch of the imagination! Just that it could be getting A LOT more bang for its (many, many) bucks.
