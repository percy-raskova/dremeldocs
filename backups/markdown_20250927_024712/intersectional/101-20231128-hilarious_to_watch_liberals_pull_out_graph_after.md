# Hilarious to watch liberals pull out graph after graph to...

Hilarious to watch liberals pull out graph after graph to find some metric to explain to people that actually, what they see in front of them is irrelevant, and they should vote for someone they don't trust. "THE RATE OF INCREASE OF AVERAGE RENT HAS FALLEN"

"My rent has gone up faster than my wages."

"LOOK AT THE SECOND DERIVATIVE OF THE MONTH OVER MONTH"

"My rent has gone up faster than my wages."

"THE GENERAL TREND OF THE PAST--"

"My rent has gone up faster than my wages." They're so frustrated, because they desperately need to find some explanation, some logic, some rhetorical strategy to convince people to vote for Democrats.

So let me be perfectly forthright: if you have to work this hard for it, you've lost the plot. There is only one metric that matters to people: their bottom line. Money in minus money out. If that number is zero or negative, people are unhappy, no matter what. Same if it's positive, but shrinking. Same if it's positive, but still represents less ability to purchase things. The only way to win people's trust is to give them more economic power. Absolute numbers don't matter: only the social phenomena they facilely attempt to reflect.

I can't afford housing where I work. I can't find livable work where I live. That's my bottom line. If you have to resort to "Well none of that is Joe Biden's fault! He didn't cause it, and he can't fix it!" you have lost even harder. You have informed people that voting for Joe Biden won't actually solve the problem. So why would they? That's the real reason people don't want to vote for Democrats. They're not vindictively trying to punish Biden for committing some grievous offense: they simply don't believe voting for him has any intersection with their material well-being. You can't possibly solve that by trying to convince them that whatever little accomplishments he has made actually should matter more to them than they do. You solve it by doing stuff that matters to them. Bold, real action Instead, they have stated very clearly that he can't. Instead, his closing argument for 2023 is... "Some -- but not all -- airlines will no longer charge you a fee to rebook if they cancel your flight."
