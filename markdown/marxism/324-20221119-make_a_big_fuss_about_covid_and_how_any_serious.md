# make a big fuss about COVID and how any serious person...

@Rocko64_ I make a big fuss about COVID and how any serious person needs to be serious about the pandemic. But I recognize just how powerful hegemony is. The sheer mental fatigue of "standing strong" in the face of a hostile culture is truly draining. Plus the dearth of good information. @Rocko64_ I've gone from "Blaming individuals is pointless, it's the fault of the ruling class spreading misinformation" to "At this point, you have to be deliberately ignorant to not care," and then back to "Having little/no energy to resist is understandable." @Rocko64_ I still see it as my responsibility to at least *inform* people on the reality of the situation. The more people that understand, the easier it is for all of us to feel like we're "allowed" to protect ourselves AND the lower the threshold for protection becomes.
