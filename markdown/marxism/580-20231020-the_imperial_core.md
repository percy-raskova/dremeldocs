# the imperial core

@magicshewrites "Leftists" of all stripes within the imperial core are materially incentivized to not dig deeper into what true liberation takes. Many can't even conceive of a world that is not economically regimented to fulfill the consumption habits of Americans. @magicshewrites And yet... we're doing it. Communism -- actual, Marxist liberation -- is growing more and more popular. Especially as conditions worsen and contradictions are heightened. In the midst of rising anti-queer mobilization, queer liberation is mobilizing as well.
