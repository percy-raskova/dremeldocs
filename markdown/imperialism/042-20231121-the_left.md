# The left

"The left" isn't being "torn apart" by "fringe issues," like Palestine, COVID, queer liberation, climate, etc. Battle lines are being drawn, forces arrayed, loyalties built, contradictions heightened. Liberals are fleeing under the crushing weight of robust, realized solidarity. The movement is still very much in its infancy here in the imperial core. We need coherent, committed revolutionary leadership. Leadership that emerges from active struggle, feeds back into heightening the struggle, and produces even more leadership. In other words, a party.
