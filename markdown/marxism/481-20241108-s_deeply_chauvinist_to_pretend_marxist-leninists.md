# s deeply chauvinist to pretend Marxist-Leninists (i.e. 

It's deeply chauvinist to pretend Marxist-Leninists (i.e. "tankies") are a bunch of privileged, straight, white men, out of touch with oppressed people. The vast majority of MLs, both historically and currently, are among the MOST oppressed cohorts in the world. Obviously China does a lot of the demographic heavy lifting there, due to sheer size. But these chauvinists are also erasing the rich -- and growing -- Marxist tradition of movements across Asia, the middle east, Africa, South America, and yes, right here in North America. It is the ideology of liberation. The organized forces of oppressed peoples, making themselves into armies capable of taking on forces ten times their size. It's the movement of the colonized, the imprisoned, the brutalized, the displaced, the ostracized. Call us "authoritarian" all you want: we are simply responding in kind. The greater the forces of oppression, the greater the force needed for liberation. It's really that simple. So simple it has been recapitulated a thousand times in a thousand places.

We're the ones who win.
