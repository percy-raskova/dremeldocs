# Those anecdotes

@Rocko64_ Those anecdotes aren't really *that* common. Modern medicine has been critical in helping people get over the hump of early death. But just like evolution worked to get people through reproducing age--and no further--capitalism has expanded that to *working* age--and no further. @Rocko64_ Among those living before modern medicine, making it to old age took good circumstances (peace, avoiding disease, sufficient nutrition, social welfare, etc.), but if you managed it, there weren't all these social ills pushing you toward a pre-80 death, such as totalistic neglect.
