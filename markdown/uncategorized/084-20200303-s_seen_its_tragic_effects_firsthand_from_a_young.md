# s seen its tragic effects firsthand from a young age, and...

As someone with a family history of neurodegenerative disease, who's seen its tragic effects firsthand from a young age, and whose greatest fear in life is experiencing it myself, I am incredibly saddened by every one of Biden's "gaffes". This isn't a joke. It's just cruel. @JoeBiden please think about what's best for you and your family. You don't have to keep doing this. Bernie will beat Trump: you don't need to stop him just to save this country. This isn't on you; we can take it from here.
