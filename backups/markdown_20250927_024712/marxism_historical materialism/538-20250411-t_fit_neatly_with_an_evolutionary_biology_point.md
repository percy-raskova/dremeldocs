# t fit neatly with an evolutionary biology point of view

"I'm convinced most biologists just skip over sharks because it doesn't fit neatly with an evolutionary biology point of view." https://t.co/xuf4Z4DfyM Historical materialism isn't a "point of view," it's an analytical method. You can apply it to literally every historical event. No historical event "refutes" it, in the same way that no painting refutes color theory, no shape refutes geometry, and no organism refutes ecology. Unless you think the American civil war was an example of eldritch gods appearing from beyond the confines of the material realm, chanting a reality-warping symphony of incomprehensible shrieks, and reshaping the forces of our world to their whim, historical materialism applies. Actually, even in that case, we would apply historical materialism to analyze the material consequences of the eldritch god incursion. How were class relations affected when everyone's brains suddenly started glowing and humming along with the Aria of the Macabre?
