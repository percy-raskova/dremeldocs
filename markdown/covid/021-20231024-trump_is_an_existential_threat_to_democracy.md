# Trump is an existential threat to democracy

@Ame0baRepublic "Trump is an existential threat to democracy" ok??? So do what you always do to threats to democracy???? @Ame0baRepublic The liberal myth is so fucking cooked. Hamas is such an existential threat to democracy that its very existence requires the bombing of 2,000 Palestinian children in 2 weeks, but Trump is also an existential threat... and your response is to scold people into not voting for him?
