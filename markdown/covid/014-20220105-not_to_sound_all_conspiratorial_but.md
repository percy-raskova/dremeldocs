# Not to sound all conspiratorial, but

Not to sound all conspiratorial, but... It absolutely feels like all this is part of a coordinated effort to cripple teachers unions. And it's not new: it's just a capstone on a decades-long campaign to undermine both teachers unions and public schools in general. These ghouls are willing to put children and their families in grave danger just to keep educators from getting uppity.
