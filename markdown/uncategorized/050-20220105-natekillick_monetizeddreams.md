# @natekillick @monetizeddreams

@natekillick @monetizeddreams @denise_dewald @Marks1Guy It looks like they may have emerged around the same time. If so, then yes, it doesn't appear to be as big of a threat currently. Possibly being edged out by Delta and omicron. Doesn't mean it's never going to be a problem though: possibly a precursor to a more infectious variant. @natekillick @monetizeddreams @denise_dewald @Marks1Guy Again, I'll reserve judgement on *this* particular variant! I'm just saying there is absolutely more on the way.
