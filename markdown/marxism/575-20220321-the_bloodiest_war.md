# the bloodiest war

Thesis: The West is currently in the process of falling to fascism. This process began 100 years ago, starting the bloodiest war in human history. After that, The West experimented with social democracy as a stopgap, but now that is failing due to sheer capitalist avarice. Western-style social democracy cannot stop fascism. It takes away enough power from capitalists to bother them, but not anywhere near enough to prevent them from undoing any social gains made. As the prospects of ordinary people decline, they become vulnerable to fascist thought.
