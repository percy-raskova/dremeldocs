# crack the spine of pan-Arabism

This is what I mean when I say that "Israel" exists as a colonial outpost of the US empire to "crack the spine of pan-Arabism" maintaining imperial access to Middle Eastern resources and shipping -- and also why I think it's not long for this world. Its usefulness is running dry. https://t.co/5GDtGRfi8D From the beginning, Israel acted as a launching pad for imperial intervention, especially with assistance in regime change operations and the capture and negotiation for the return of tactically significant territory. Some notable examples include:

The Suez crisis, where Israel worked on behalf of the dying British and French empires to secure Red Sea shipping.

The infiltration of Syria's government and military by Israeli spies to empower anti-Egypt forces. The normalization treaties with Egypt, Jordan, and UAE, exchanging demilitarization for open trade with the west, once amenable (collaborationist) governments had been assured.

It's not just Israel's mere presence in the region -- it's its military actions. What the Palestinian resistance is doing right now is shattering the illusion of IOF supremacy. No matter how well supplied it is by the US, Israel now only has the power to ravage civilian populations, not fight against an organized military, let alone the entire Arab world. However, the surrounding states would never join the fight under the current collaborationist regimes, who are enticed and empowered by western capital. They have no incentive to divest themselves from the same empire that assured them their power, and threatens their stability. That is exactly why the international arm of the resistance's strategy is so focused on hampering shipment of goods out and weapons in. The worst outcome for the empire, and the primary horizon of Palestinian liberation, is an Arab world divested from US interests. The end of collaboration would send shockwaves across the entire world, destroying the US's entire geopolitical strategy. Unfortunately for them, that strategy relies on a projection of unshakeable military hegemony. And that hegemony has been revealed for the paper tiger it is.
