# my second statement

@primarycatdad @Convict_No9653 I thought you were talking about my view of mass line (my second statement).

I *do* think of PPW and ND as tactics. I was just using flowery language when I said that PPW can be thought of as universal in an abstract sense. The tactic isn't universal, but the philosophy is. @primarycatdad @Convict_No9653 At least *my interpretation* of it as a philosophy. The notion of constantly drawing the enemy into "battlefields" you control, setting the terms of engagement, seizing initiative, bolstering the broader community against enemy incursions, etc.
