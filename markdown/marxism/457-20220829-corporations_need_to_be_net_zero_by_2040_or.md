# Corporations need to be net zero by 2040 or stockholders...

If it was possible for climate change to be solved by the free market, and if bourgeois democracy was able to even want that, capitalist governments could simply pass laws that said "Corporations need to be net zero by 2040 or stockholders will face criminal charges." Instead, they pass pathetic subsidies for wind and solar, while simultaneously passing even bigger subsidies for expanded fossil fuel use. In the name of "pragmatism" and "balance."

This is true of literally every capitalist liberal democracy.
