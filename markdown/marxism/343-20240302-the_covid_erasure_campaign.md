# the COVID erasure campaign

A liberal posts an objectively true statement about how we should be wearing masks at pro-Palestine protests, but has a history of using these tactics to decry liberation movements, so now I get to watch "revolutionaries" reveal that they fell for the COVID erasure campaign. In case you forgot, I wrote an entire step-by-step analysis on how and why the entire capitalist-run world tried to disappear COVID, and why it is an act of pure reactionary cowardice to accept that liberal framing.

https://t.co/7cUBHzAXrK You can be a liberal -- even an ardently counter-revolutionary one -- and agree with this.

You cannot call yourself a revolutionary if you ignore it.

Full commitment to public health is as central to communism as anti-imperialism (something many of you fail at as well). When I see you say "No one is masking anymore, so we'll lose support if we insist," I see cowards, tailists, people with no desire to educate or learn. Stagnant, impotent, unambitious reformists, no better than liberals waving a flag in facile "solidarity" and then going home. It is our unending duty to constantly push our movement forward. We do not tolerate chauvinism in our movement, we seek out and destroy abuse and opportunism, we demand of ourselves a coherent, uncompromising agenda of the abolition of all institutions of the bourgeois regime. Just as that means standing against imperialism, it also includes fighting the unfathomably massive burden of death and disability brought down on our heads by the capitalist medical system. The two are far from unrelated and it is the job of revolutionaries to MAKE them related. If you don't believe it can be done, you have no right calling yourself a revolutionary. If you don't think it SHOULD be done, because it's "not important," you are a complete fool, suckered in by the same liberal propaganda you claim to have left behind. And yes, The Person we're talking about clearly has ill intentions. Liberalism run roughshod to skewer movements in the way it always does. We can make ourselves immune to falsified "critique" by donning the invulnerable armor of scientific socialism.

Stop. Obeying. Liberalism.
