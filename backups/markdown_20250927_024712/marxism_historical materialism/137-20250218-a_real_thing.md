# a real thing

The secret?

That was never a real thing at all. The image you have in your mind was put there by fiction written by trust fund kids roleplaying as "struggling lost souls," when they could always just run home to the bourgeois life.

And when their work took off, they did. https://t.co/7e124OJgsp The concept you're thinking of is likely Bohemianism, a literary and artistic trend of the 19th and 20th centuries. It was popularized predominantly by the descendants of literal aristocrats, who romanticized the "freedom" of poverty. They were especially enamored with Romani. They had what can only be described as a "noble savage view of normies," relishing the image of a sort of urban nomad, unburdened by the "trappings" of high society, hopping from couch to couch, gig to gig, tenament to tenament Of course there were some in this movement who legitimately did grow up in poverty, and wrote about their honest experiences. And the rare dose of reality injected into the scene only fueled the romanticism further. It was always a fabrication. That genre was almost exclusively consumed by the "upper middle class" or higher, who either pined from afar or took up the garb of poverty for themselves and embarked on their little vacations. Now we have a facsimile of a facsimile. A modern trend of pining for the Bohemians. I knew one when I was a researcher: a grad student at one of the top universities in the country who cosplayed as a 19th century cosplayer, yet somehow traveled for fun, multiple times a year.
