# social conservatism

@m1vql1hdwt Seriously, these guys are a bunch of obfuscating, eclectic weirdos, mixing vaguely revolutionary-adjacent rhetoric with "social conservatism" and an incoherent set of reformist-at-best policies. @m1vql1hdwt They don't even acknowledge man-made climate change (and by the sounds of it, might believe the Earth is only thousands of years old?).

"We will not be seduced by the more apocalyptic Green hysteria that floods our media" oh fuck OFF
