# honestly have to wonder about things like this 

I honestly have to wonder about things like this.

How much of the masklessness among the ruling class is actual bravado and ignorance, and how much is "virtue signaling," while they maintain careful protections behind the scenes? https://t.co/KSSVpCcOPf "Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Capitol Building and Congressional Office Buildings remain closed to the public."

And yet, the plan was to fully reopen the second the House was sworn in (which has been delayed).

https://t.co/IDkzkYkPl7 Congress members are not required to get tested, quarantine, report cases/exposure, or any other "invisible" measure to mitigate the spread of COVID.

So I'm forced to conclude that they really do just think they're invincible. ðŸ™„
