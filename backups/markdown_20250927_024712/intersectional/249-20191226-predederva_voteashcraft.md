# @predederva @VoteAshcraft

@predederva @VoteAshcraft It's pretty simple.

First, you heavily tax corporations who ship jobs overseas. Couple that with a wealth tax to take back some of the massive gains individuals made off exploitative labor practices.

Then, you open up immigration policy to allow an influx of workers (pt. 1/3). @predederva @VoteAshcraft By ensuring immigrant workers have legal status, you allow them the same labor protections as native citizens, so they earn the same wages, pay the same taxes, etc.

Now you've increased the pool of taxable income, thereby generating more tax revenue. (2/3) @predederva @VoteAshcraft You keep using that increased revenue to fund more and more federal jobs, growing our economy--and our tax base--with each new job, giving us more money to create more jobs.

Since the money being earned is generally immediately spent, it continues to cycle through the economy.
