# Elizabeth Warren

Elizabeth Warren should have dropped out and backed Bernie before Super Tuesday. I say this not out of love for Bernie, or the belief that she has a duty to the left.

It would have been the best move for her politically. First of all, it would have helped combat the narrative that Biden was locking up the race, just because he won a single contest and was endorsed by centrists. This may have been enough for Bernie to win. She could have made a deal to join his ticket in exchange for her help. Second, if Bernie still ended up losing, she would have had more leverage with Biden. The race would have been closer, with the progressive faction representing a larger portion of the electorate. She would have a larger claim to ownership of the base, and could have used that.
