# t that 

@UpTheRahxD Yeah, my point wasn't that "those types" are monolithically regressive, or even that those who do hold regressive views are "irredeemable." Just that that's the main cohort that has that stereotype projected onto them by people who are completely sheltered from The Poors™️. @UpTheRahxD The heuristic, as ever, is "are you so attached to your regressivism that you exclude yourself from the collective material struggle?" It's a simple bargain to make when the struggle is life or death -- the choice is as clear as choosing to leave a burning building.
