# an estimated average

Over the course of 70 years, the USSR built an estimated average of 2 million new urban housing units per year, as the urban population ballooned from 25 million to 229 million. https://t.co/Jym8SEkl9D What leftists are *actually* opposed to is the iron grip on housing by the vampiric entity known as the capitalist class. They sap our lifeblood, grow fat off it, then use their stolen wealth to buy more of our world, parceling it back out in exchange for our continued indenture. And no, we don't want to "build more public housing," or subsidize the bloodletting with "housing vouchers," (a sleight of hand to redirect our communal money to the exact same capitalists). We want to ELIMINATE the housing market. Capital cannot be allowed to dictate human need. Every. Scrap. Of. Land. Every inch, every brick, every window.

And yes, this is inextricable from the abolition of the settler colony colloquially known as "The United States," and the return of every stolen inch to the nations that that theft has been used to dominate.
