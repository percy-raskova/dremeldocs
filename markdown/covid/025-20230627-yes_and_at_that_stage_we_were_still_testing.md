# Yes, and at that stage, we were still testing, hospitals...

@BoobyJargon Yes, and at that stage, we were still testing, hospitals were required to report their numbers, and people were, by and large, making an effort to avoid infection. When was the last time you or anyone you know even bothered to get tested? @BoobyJargon Asymptomatic cases account for about 40% of cases. Mild cases are over 80% -- you know, those "flus" happening in June? At all levels of severity, and regardless of vaccination status, your long-term health is impacted, cumulatively with every infection.
