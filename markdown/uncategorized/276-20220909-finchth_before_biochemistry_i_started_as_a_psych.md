# @FinchTH Before biochemistry, I started as a psych major in...

@FinchTH Before biochemistry, I started as a psych major in undergrad. Had to drop it because of the utter lack of rigor. The entire discipline feels like storytelling. Everything is geared toward confirming priors, rather than trying to exclude confounding variables. @FinchTH It's not completely worthless, obviously. But it's so hard to find good research in the field when you get shit like "Anxiety causes post-acute sequelae" spoken without a trace of irony. @FinchTH I realize that my comment may sound disrespectful toward you and your profession, which is not my intention. Obviously you understand the issue. I'm just venting, due to the constant gaslighting about how this is "all in the mind."
