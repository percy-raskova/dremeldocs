# The simplest aspect

The simplest aspect of this phenomenon is simply selection bias: you're drawing on examples of giant things across a variety of eras. Throughout history, all you would need is one example of "the biggest ape ever" or "the biggest bird ever," to point to... (1/12) https://t.co/H75T1rjcXw ... as an example of how much "smaller" animals are now. In fact, there are many counterexamples when you take a more holistic view: for example, the current era is undeniably The Age of Giant Mammals, compared to our size when our tiny ancestors emerged in the Mesozoic. (2/12) Before that, therapsids were pretty huge, but on the whole, modern mammals have reached comparatively staggering sizes. Following the K-Pg extinction, the enormous dinosaurs died out due to the sharp decline in food availability. Less sun-&gt; less plant growth -&gt; less energy (3/12) Adaptive radiation of those tiny, burrowing early mammals took off, since they needed much less energy. Many later adapted to fill empty niches, including the various "Biggest Thing Around" niches. More plants meant giant herbivores, and therefore giant carnivores. (4/12) Over the course of tens of millions of years, huge species emerged, but then disappeared. The biggest organisms are also the most vulnerable to environmental changes, because slight perturbations can't be adapted to as easily. (5/12) Large organisms need long reproductive cycles to gather the resources necessary to reproduce, which means slower evolution.

So the best explanation of why there are relatively few giant animals right now is that there are ALWAYS relatively few giant animals... (6/12) ... due to ecological constraints. And the ones that exist are the quickest to disappear when environmental conditions change.

The final note I'll make is that a lot of megafauna died out shortly after the appearance of humans in their ecosystems. (7/12) This is mainly due to us competing for the same resources that they did. Hunting is also partially to blame, but for most extinct megafauna species, the main threat was just humans being much more efficient at gathering limited resources. (8/12) We also deliberately pushed away those species that competed with us. The human evolutionary strategy kinda subverts that pattern of larger species having less capacity to adapt to changes in environments: we are the supreme generalists. (9/12) Humans use sociality and tools to adapt to almost every ecosystem we have ever encountered. But we're certainly not immune to that fundamental geophysical constraint. We can't get energy from nowhere, and we can't photosynthesize. (10/12) That's the problem with climate change: environmental conditions are changing so rapidly that organisms throughout the food web of ALL ecosystems are dying out, and the energy flow falls apart. The current era is not currently characterized by unusually tiny animals. (11/12)
