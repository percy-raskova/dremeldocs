# The more bourgeois society

The more bourgeois society degrades the well-being of those it dominates, the more it is exposed in the eyes of masses as fundamentally incapable of providing them with anything real: housing, food, health, safety. Instead, it must rely on idealist abstractions, like "liberty." https://t.co/qYihcKywNM In questions like "freedom to sell your organs," we can see clearly the true horror of these liberal ideals. An argument barely even needs to be made to explain the absurdity of presenting "willingly" harvesting your own body to sell on the market as "freedom." Anyone who has not had their senses of empathy and self-preservation surgically removed by the knife of liberalism can instantly feel the visceral repulsion at this prospect. Freedom to be dismembered. Freedom to serve. Freedom to shiver and starve, alone and abandoned. These are the "freedoms" offered to us by liberalism.

Central to all liberal conceptions of "rights" is the right of property, and for those who own no property, their rights begin and end at the right to turn their bodies into a commodity. You have the freedom to sell this commodity, piecemeal, however you like: sell your labor power; sell your organs; sell your womb; sell sexual access; sell your entire life to die in the service of empire.

Capitalism drives liberal society to commodify every particle of life. Your rights only extend to this depraved access to the market, which seeks only to butcher you into appetizing cuts of meat. What freedom! The freedom of abject slavery.

Never ask what freedoms liberalism must subjugate to guarantee your right to exploitation. Freedom to live. Freedom to eat. Freedom to be healthy. Freedom to learn and grow and build. Liberalism doesn't care about these *communal* freedoms. The freedom of capital to bulldoze forests and tear down existing communities is above the freedom of those communities to exist. The freedom of an individual to breathe clean air is subservient to the freedom of the factory to belch toxic smoke. The freedom of a parent to "raise children however they want" takes precedence over a child to not be abused.

And "bodily autonomy"? There is no such thing. You may be granted the "freedom" to sell your organs, but not the freedom to never have to even consider that "option." You have the freedom to not get vaccinated against deadly infectious diseases, but not the freedom *from* those diseases. A right to "bodily autonomy" is impossible under capitalism, where the needs of your body must be gated behind the control of capital to maintain property relations. If you were guaranteed these rights, you could not be compelled to work for wages to access them. Communism promises you one thing: that you have the right to all the gains of society, simply for being a part of it. No need to sell yourself to capital to purchase these rights. You have the right to live, to fill your belly, to be healthy, to thrive, to keep ALL your organs.
