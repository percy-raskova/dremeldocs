# an entire category

There exists an entire category of "Marxists" who believe that production happens in the sky, using materials pulled from thin air. They see the seizure of land as a historical event and genocide as a cost of concentrating production into one place for proletarian seizure. They are willfully ignorant of the dialectic between land and capital, the latter's need to constantly cut into the former and keep the blood flowing freely, using that blood to grow its teeth and sink them deeper. They see the movement to end this bloodletting as "moralizing." This isn't just a question of justice, of one genetic lineage having a moral entitlement over another. It's about undermining the very foundation of the capitalist project. Decolonization isn't just about liberating the *people*, it's about liberating the *land*. The same is true for every liberation movement of every oppressed population. The oppression isn't just "capital being mean." The cruelty is NOT the point. Each particular form of oppression serves a material function for the regime -- and is a key vulnerability. Relegating particularized oppression to the realm of "We'll deal with it by getting rid of capitalism" is like dismissing each battlefield by saying "We'll just win the war, then the battlefields will disappear."

You win the war by fighting on its many battlefields. When you see many different militias springing up to fight in isolated battles against the same enemy, you don't tell them "Why are you so obsessed with defending your own village? Don't you see that it'll all be taken care of once the war ends?" You JOIN those battles. You include those fighters in a growing logistical network. You bring them weapons and food. You send them reinforcements and tactical briefings. You bring their generals on board to central command. You make their needs and resources the needs and resources of the collective. This "analogy" is not some idle illustrative exercise: it's the exact progression of every successful revolution in history. It's how the Red Army was built. It's what's happening in Palestine as we speak. And it's what has to happen here as well.
