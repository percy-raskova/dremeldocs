# like 50 different technologies

@SenorTren Absolutely wild to me that this video is supposed to imply that crabs are so advanced for moving sand into a dome shape, while the post itself required the use of like 50 different technologies the crab couldn't even conceive of in literally a hundred million years. @SenorTren These idiots invented "dig special sand hole" before there were even mammals, and they've rested on their laurels ever since.
