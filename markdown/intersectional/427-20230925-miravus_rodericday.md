# @miravus @RodericDay

@miravus @RodericDay I was hyperbolizing for the sake of illustrating the overall bent of the video. He does not "excoriate" MMT, he spends the majority of the video explaining how great it is, then dedicates a fifth as much time to saying "But then capitalists muck up what would otherwise be great!" @miravus @RodericDay It's virtually indistinguishable from the sort of liberal "progressivism" that wants to "get big money out of politics" and "raise taxes on the wealthy." It is not Marxism, and the problems he does acknowledge will not go away without completely expropriating the capitalist class @miravus @RodericDay If we want to be very charitable to the "turn" in the final section, the only way to do so is to say "Luckily, he finishes the video by explaining why the entire video was pointless!"
