# the Tucker interview

@m1vql1hdwt The joke is that throughout the Tucker interview, he asks Putin some surface-level question, and Putin answers with like 2,000 years of historical context. https://t.co/jyewARfaY2 @m1vql1hdwt And then right on the heels of that, we got a deluge of memes about Kamala's "you think you fell out of a coconut tree?" comment. 

We did it, folks. Historical materialism is cool again ðŸ˜Ž
