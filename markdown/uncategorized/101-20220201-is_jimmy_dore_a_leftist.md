# Is Jimmy Dore a Leftist

If I wanted to start a moderately successful YouTube channel, I would make a video called "Is Jimmy Dore a Leftist?", wait for his fans to brigade the video, then bring it to the attention of more established leftist YouTubers. My second video would be "Responding to Comments on My Jimmy Dore Video." The third video would be "Jimmy Dore's Grift EXPOSED!"

Then I would drop it entirely and talk about stuff that actually matters.
