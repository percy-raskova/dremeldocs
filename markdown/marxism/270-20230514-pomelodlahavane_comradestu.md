# @PomelodlaHavane @ComradeStu

@PomelodlaHavane @ComradeStu There are a number of errors with this line of reasoning. The foremost of which is that it is impossible to overthrow capitalism without armed revolution. The state has and will continue to use violence to put down any spontaneous insurrection. @PomelodlaHavane @ComradeStu We can of course *begin* our struggle with non-violent labor organizing. But the moment we present any significant challenge to the capitalist order -- or even a whiff of a challenge -- we will be met with guns. It is naive to believe they will simply roll over. @PomelodlaHavane @ComradeStu The incidence of fascist reaction has already been ramping up, even without any coherent, unified mass struggle. What do you expect would happen if we just declared a general strike (something that we are currently laughably distant from having a chance at even attempting)?
