# an extremely enthusiastic US state apparatus

You realize the instant the occupation collapses, all those motherfuckers are getting IMMEDIATELY folded into an extremely enthusiastic US state apparatus, right? The scale of it is gonna make Operation Paperclip look like child's play. Whoops! Had to close comments. Nazis are getting wayyyyy too comfortable laundering their "(((Certain people))) run the world" ideology through the veneer of antizionism. Think of Nazis, not just recruited for rocketry programs, but police departments, the military, schools, local governance, everywhere you can think of. Hundreds of thousands of organized, ideologically-regimented fascists. To be clear, I'm not talking about a fundamental, qualitative change in character. I'm talking about redeployment. A *quantitative* change, a mass reabsorption of the forces of a collective fascism that has been stretched too thin for the empire's purposes.
