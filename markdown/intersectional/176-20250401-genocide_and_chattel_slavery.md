# genocide and chattel slavery

What a thing to say about a country literally founded on the principles of genocide and chattel slavery.

Even the facile liberal conceptions of "democracy" and "equality" and "liberty" have only applied to rich, white, straight men for the majority of this country's existence. https://t.co/4RlFxD9KJk Are reservations not "authoritarianism"? Are plantations? Concentration camps? Sweatshops? Ghettos? Being barred from voting, holding office, employment, housing, loans, divorce? Flimsy discrimination protections for trans people existed for less than 2% of US history. And that's just the surface -- the liberal pretension of "pluralism" that has NEVER unseated the violence and oppression at the core of this country. Every city an occupation, every prison a concentration camp, every border a war zone.

This has always been the bourgeois regime.
