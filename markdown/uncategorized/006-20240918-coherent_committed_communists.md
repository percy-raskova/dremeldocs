# coherent, committed communists

That thing would have been to stop being nebulous and start being coherent, committed communists. Know what you're truly fighting for, and truly fight for it. Stop getting in bed with liberals -- they will never love you back.

Also, read a goddamn book. https://t.co/q94X0dy4gF (As long as I'm yelling at my 23-year-old self: you should just bite the bullet and get on estrogen. Trust me, it's not as scary as it sounds.)
