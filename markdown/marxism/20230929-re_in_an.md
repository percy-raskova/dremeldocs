# re in an 

You do not know if you're in an "at-risk population." This phrase is just a propaganda trick to ease in the abdication of public health. The implication becomes "If this ends up affecting you, you were retroactively 'at-risk,' and should have figured out how to protect yourself." https://t.co/ICFGFYACva I don't like to throw around the term "eugenics," but that's explicitly what it is. "Public health" is not about keeping the public healthy by preventing illness: it's about passively allowing the "weak" to die or retreat from public life, so that only the healthy remain visible. Aside from the obvious moral reprehensibility of simply discarding entire segments of the population, this approach is a literal death spiral. Because "healthy" is not a permanent status. You can become disabled at the drop of a hat, through injury, infection, aging, and more. As soon as you do -- and again, EVERYONE will, as they age -- you are no longer eligible for protection by the "public health-by-default" system, whose only purpose is to maintain a minimal baseline so that the *entire* city doesn't die of dysentery at once (1% is fine, though). Now is the time for revolutionary organizing. Mutual aid is a good start, but it simply cannot fill the social gap left by a state that is explicitly pursuing a policy of social murder. We need to form a public health corps. We need labor, infrastructure, materials, expertise. Most of all, we need organizational discipline and ambition. We need a commitment and a plan to challenge the hegemonic liberal political order that is actively destroying the health of our entire society. We need to divest public health from capital entirely. I'm working on a model for this as we speak. Obviously, I don't know everything, and obviously I can't DO anything on my own. I'm actively seeking guidance and collaboration from anyone and everyone committed to the goal of building a revolutionary public health apparatus. DM me!
