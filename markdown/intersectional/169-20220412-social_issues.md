# social issues

Any "leftist" who uses the phrase "social issues" in a dismissive way is in desperate need of a thorough education in historical materialism.

There is no way to disentangle "social issues" from "economic issues." It is ALL relevant to the material needs of the working class. Just because liberals use completely facile discussions of race to avoid addressing deeper economic issues does not mean we get to pretend race isn't a profound effector of the material world. Especially not when the fascists are using race as part of their central dogma.
