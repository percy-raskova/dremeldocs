# an inextricable link

There is an inextricable link between U.S. military "overreach," global fascism, and the climate crisis. The military cannot simply "scale back": it is the chassis for the engine of the U.S. economy. The fuel? Natural resources and unequal exchange, ripped from the global south. https://t.co/jPfdDpJOAH There is a gulf of reckoning with this among the so-called "progressive" wing of U.S. politics. They cry crocodile tears over a bloated military budget, over war profiteering, over hawkish geopolitical policy. But they are trying to negotiate where negotiation is impossible. Every "anti war" stance held by fresh political faces gets swept away the second they achieve power. Not just because they were faking it, or because they got bought off by the military industrial complex, but because they have been onboarded into the fundamental U.S. project. They have been educated on the real role of the military. It's not American Exceptionalism, hunger for the blood of foreigners, or hot-headed patriotism. It is necessary for the continuation of capitalism. And it is burning the planet in the process.
