# SOME autoimmune disorders

@An_Aria_Blooms Did you know that feminizing hormones increase the incidence of SOME autoimmune disorders, but not others? It's really cool in the abstract sense, because it indicates that some disorders have to do with hormones, some have to do with sex chromosomes, some are a combination... @An_Aria_Blooms ... some have to do with environmental factors, like infections or exposure to inorganic substances. It's wild how complicated the immune system is, and nothing is a simple one-to-one relationship.
