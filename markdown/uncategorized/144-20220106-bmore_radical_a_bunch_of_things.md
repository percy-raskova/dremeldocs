# @bmore_radical A bunch of things

@bmore_radical A bunch of things. But most pertinent is how I predicted *perfectly* how omicron would go, back when it was just a few cases in South Africa. I was "100% certain," but really I was saying "If we don't address this now, we will look like morons and people will die." @bmore_radical And then recently, I said I was "certain" that we will see a variant that is more deadly than omicron, but still highly infectious, and someone said "You can't be certain!"

No, I can't. But I have very good reasons for believing it will happen.
