# @neqoxec I spent like a year getting increasingly...

@neqoxec I spent like a year getting increasingly frustrated that any time I proposed we Do Something, I was told I was Egotistical or Unrealistic or Authoritarian. ARE YOU OR ARE YOU NOT TRYING TO BUILD SOCIALISM? (The answer was obviously no, and I'm ashamed it took so long to realize.) @neqoxec I liken the sensation to the way people talk about transitioning. Just constant discomfort with no clue why, until suddenly something *clicks* and you realize the discomfort was dysphoria the whole time.
