# @RachelNagant Biohackers

@RachelNagant Biohackers are the dumbest pieces of shit. There's no way to confirm she even did what she said she did, that it worked, what the downstream effects are, etc. The entire community is basically just people looking at some theoretical paper and going "Ooh, now I know everything!" @RachelNagant I can't possibly fit all the problems with this into one tweet, but suffice to say, there's no evidence this even happened at all, let alone that it worked. Anyone can just go on an internet forum and write "btw guys, I cured cancer with this transgene! Look, here's a .txt!"
