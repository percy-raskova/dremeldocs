        "smushed_text": "I'm sincerely hoping this is a consequence of still recovering from pneumonia, but my brain is alarmingly quiet these days. The second, third, fourth, etc. streams of consciousness, usually constantly chattering and considering things are just... not there? Like, my brain is usually a deliberative body, where external stimuli and internal resolutions are considered and debated across multiple subcommittees until draft proposals can be brought before the committee of the whole, where I can consciously consider things. Obviously those processes go on inside everyone's minds, subconsciously, at all times. You usually just automatically ignore it, unless you're actively trying to think about your thinking. But I definitely think about my thinking a lot, and I can hear those debates constantly. To be clear, this isn't exactly something that's an unqualified good. It's what allows me to have 500 theses brewing at all times, but also what keeps me from actually WRITING any of it down coherently. I think ADHD meds might help me resolve those debates in a timely manner. But right now, my typical issue is inverted. I can't summon up the chatter at all. I don't exactly feel like I'm in a fugue state, I just feel... normal? Like I don't have anything groundbreaking to share. I can still carry on a conversation obviously. It's hard to describe this without sounding haughty, like \"Ohhhh I'm usually such a profound genius of unique insight and right now I'm just a normie.\"\n\nI don't really think there's a dichotomy between \"genius vs. normie,\" and insight really does come out of diverse thoughts. But I do think my particular skill comes in the form of synthesis, pulling together those diverse insights, distilling them into a compelling narrative, and sharing them with others.\n\nI'm really hoping the quietude in my brain is temporary. Because I have so much more to share.",

        "smushed_text": "You're probably aware of climate feedback loops: for example, polar ice melting into water, which is much better at absorbing solar energy, thereby speeding up the warming.\n\nA feedback loop you probably *haven't* heard about has to do with the ocean's mysterious twilight zone. In the twilight zone, sunlight can't make it through all the water, so photosynthesis is not possible. However, it's full of animal life, adapted to the dark.\n\nWhere do they get their food? Some of them eat other twilight zone animals, but the rest have to swim up! https://t.co/7xDPSNJqwH Every night, marine animals swim to the surface to eat. Because they're adapted to darkness, they can scavenge on abundant food, while predators won't be able to see them.\n\nAs the sun rises, they return to the safety of the twilight zone. This is called diel vertical migration. https://t.co/d3YMcQCmd3 So why is this important?\n\nThe stuff that they're eating is made of carbon. Carbon dioxide is pulled out of the environment by plants to make food. Normally, when animals die, the decomposition process releases carbon back into the environment as CO2. https://t.co/94BpABuvZq However, these twilight zone animals, returning daily to the depths, often die (or poop) too far down for this to happen in the normal way. Instead, much of their carbon finds its way further and further down. This is a form of carbon sequestration, trapping carbon under the sea. https://t.co/6wZXIMFkX7 Sequestration is an important part of the natural carbon cycle, preventing massive swings in atmospheric carbon.\n\nThis natural carbon sink hasn't been well-studied in the past, but we now know that it might account for 14% or more of total sequestration on the planet! https://t.co/tjDOdXydTL Considering that the massive buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere comes from human activity nudging the scales a few percentage points out of balance, 14% is huge.\n\nAnd diel vertical migration is in danger because of climate change. Even subtle nudges make huge long-term differences. Many of the animals involved in this process are zooplankton. Their small size makes them very susceptible to subtle changes, like higher ocean temperatures or ocean acidification.\n\nThey're similarly subject to the whims of ocean currents, which are impacted by climate change. Surface temperature also impacts how much the water mixes, aerates, and distributes nutrients. As the water heats up, it becomes more stagnant, making it harder for living things to eat, breathe, and grow. These factors also impact the plants they feed on, which are the vital first step in this carbon sequestration. Less plant growth means less animal growth means less ocean floor poop means more carbon dioxide staying in the atmosphere. This isn't all doom and gloom though!\n\nThis massive carbon sink is damaged, but still robust. The second we stop pumping carbon into the atmosphere, this natural cycle can bounce back--if we were to actually do that *right now.*",

This equips them with:\n\na) The repeatedly reinforced experience of what an appropriate relationship looks like.\n\nb) Numerous options for support if someone violates that trust. \"Abuse,\" in this case, goes beyond sexual assault or violence. Children of all ages are constantly subjected to emotional abuse and intense social pressures that can be internalized and normalized in the context of a stunted social sphere. Something I am particularly sensitive to is the trauma inflicted on queer children, for whom their \"designated adults\" are often the biggest sources of that trauma, in which case they certainly can't be trusted as confidants or supporters. Such kids often seek out role models among the queer adults they see as safe. Those adults often offer the guidance and community they wish they had received growing up. This type of relationship is absolutely critical for reducing the damage done to queer youth. And it is frankly disgusting to feed into the fascist narrative that such relationships are a form of \"grooming.\"\n\nYou are not \"protecting kids\" by keeping them away from people who can mentor and support them. Queerness is just the example I am most personally familiar with, but there are tons of other examples.\n\nChildren coming from a fraught home life -- even if not directly abusive to them -- often seek outside adult guidance. Same with children in poverty, or with absent parents. There are so many ways a minor and an adult can interact in appropriate and beneficial ways. Sometimes, it can literally be the difference between life and death.",

        "smushed_text": "Last night B-more school board voted 6-3 to pass a policy that 99.4% of teachers oppose. We came out in a MASSIVE show of force to voice our many, MANY concerns, both logical and emotional, and they steamrolled over us anyway. (pt. 1) The policy gives principals the power to perform formal observations UNannounced. Essentially, at any time, an administrator can walk into a classroom, and based on how well we conform to the \"instructional framework,\" determine our effectiveness as educators (pt. 2) Our opposition to the policy is not due to a desire to avoid accountability, but due to the flawed nature of the framework itself, and how its subjectivity and arbitrary structure can be used in a punitive way (pt. 3) Under this policy, an administrator can enter the classroom of a teacher they don't like, and use a strict interpretation of the evaluation rubric to rate the teacher \"ineffective.\" This not only affects the progression of our careers, it's also a slap in the face. (pt. 4) There are so many subtle, intersecting reasons this is a problem. For one thing, research shows that black and male teachers are consistently rated lower, even when their student outcomes are the same, revealing underlying biases on the part of evaluators. (pt. 5) An important part of the instructional framework is classroom decorum, i.e. the ability to keep students in their seats, quiet, hands to themselves, etc. These are all things that students in impoverished communities have trouble with, meaning... (pt. 6) ... teachers at high-poverty schools consistently score lower on their evaluations. When a teacher moves to a \"better\" school, their evaluations IMMEDIATELY go up. So strict evaluations are a great way of telling teachers NOT to work at the very schools that need them. (pt. 7) Another issue is the disparity in culture btwn schools, with regard to the relationship btwn teachers and admin. In schools with supportive admin, this isn't as much of an issue, but in schools where the mgmt style is more confrontational, this gives admin a new weapon. (pt. 8) There are many, many more problems with the new policy, but all in all, it creates an atmosphere of stress and fear for teachers. That's why teachers oppose it. And unfortunately, that's why admin and the board support it. (pt. 9)",

A lot of theoretical work has been done over the past century to present a Marxist analysis of fascism (some more useful than others).\n(2/23) Unfortunately, there's no simple way to distill fascism into digestible soundbites like \"capitalism in decay\" or \"colonialism being applied to the metropole\" or some vague \"response to crisis.\"\n(3/23) Understanding fascism and its relationship to the concepts of liberalism, capitalism, colonialism, etc. is critical for being able to mount our defense against it, especially as multiple camps of fascism consolidate in their attempts to outflank each other.\n(4/23) I am currently in the process of writing a book-length treatise (working title: Blood, Bile, and Bethlehem) to examine the mechanics of bourgeois hegemony and the liberal regime, including the role of fascism.\n\nWhat follows is an excerpt from the working draft:\n(5/23) For those already familiar with theories of socialism, it may be useful to draw parallels between the dynamics of liberalism and fascism with those of socialism.\n(6/23) Although both liberalism and fascism rely heavily on a metaphysical framework and eschew any scientific analysis that disputes the essentialist core of the ideology, liberalism is more akin to utopian socialism.\n(7/23) Meanwhile, the philosophy of fascism is a close parallel to the intentionality of scientific socialism.\n\nMarxism stands opposed to the rootless idealism of utopian and anarchist strains of \u201cleft thought,\u201d and teaches its students to apply rigorous, materialist analysis...\n(8/23) ... in service of political liberation, focusing on the economic basis at the core of oppression.\n\nIn a sinister inversion of this philosophy, fascism purports to hold the same attitude toward liberalism \u2014 without allowing its \u201canalysis\u201d to be besmirched by empiricism.\n(9/23) Where the central analytical lens of socialist ideologies is class \u2014 which simultaneously exists as both outcome and driving force of oppression \u2014 the lynchpin of liberal thought is the nation.\n(10/23) It endlessly seeks to naturalize the nation as the primary, immutable core of social life, thereby obfuscating class dynamics both internal to and between nations.\n\nWhere communism is the movement to build working class consciousness and wield it as a political force...\n(11/23) fascism can be said to be \u201cgreat-national consciousness.\u201d Specifically, it is the consciousness among the oppressor nation of its own lofty position in the economically-rooted social hierarchy.\n(12/23) Many theorists have posited fascism as being rooted in \"false consciousness,\" wherein a particular subsection of oppressed classes come to enthusiastically embrace the very social relations that oppress them. However, this analysis is shallow and misleading.\n(13/23) Great-nation consciousness is not false by any stretch of the imagination: it is a recognition among a population materially advantaged by the national arrangement. They become aware of the objectively true nature of that social relation and actively work to embolden it.\n(14/23) The \u201cfalseness\u201d is not that recognition, but the presumed immutability and \u201cnaturalness\u201d of the relation. That fascism subsumes the class relation into the national relation is not a case of mistaken analysis, but the explicit goal of the ideology.\n(15/23) Where liberalism has already done the centuries-long work of defining, stratifying, and naturalizing the national hierarchy, all in service of regimenting and mystifying its hegemonic grip on society, fascism seeks to bring the national relation to its highest level.\n(16/23) Fascism doesn't obfuscate its mission, and makes explicit the \u201cimplicit\u201d political-economic hierarchy on which bourgeois hegemony is founded.\n\nLiberalism reifies the nation; fascism deifies it.\n(17/23) The purpose of this elevation of the national relation under fascism is, of course, the same as it ever was under liberalism. It is not, as the vulgar materialists formulate, a way of \u201chiding\u201d class relations, but of materially reinforcing them.\n(18/23) The national arrangement does not exist to \u201cdistract\u201d the working class from the reality of our oppression, but to materially enrich those assigned to the oppressor nation and materially disempower those assigned oppression.\n(19/23) This creates a real, material base out of which a portion of those exploited under capitalism can justifiably see themselves advantaged by it. The \u201cdistraction,\u201d then, is in the framing of the plunder of national oppression and colonial extraction...\n(20/23) ... (which, naturally, is still apportioned by class) as being a worthwhile bargain for the great-national working class.\n\nFor the petty bourgeoisie, the bargain is even more salient: their already-greater portion of the proceeds of expropriation expands even faster.\n(21/23) By heightening the national hierarchy and expanding that expropriation, the petty bourgeoisie of the oppressor nation also sees the elimination of a portion of their competitors, and deepens the precarity of the working class, assuaging their fear of falling into it.\n(22/23) [There is a lot of context lost by presenting this excerpt, including the definition of the nation, and discussions of fascist expropriation along lines other than the nation: notably gender, queerness, and disability. But this thread needs to wrap up at some point.]\n(23/23)",

It's simply too new: we know it can last for over a year after infection, but we don't know if the multitude of systems injured in the process can eventually heal, or if they continue to get worse over time. We don't know if *some* systems degenerate while others heal. We don't know if that hypothetical degeneration  would be as common as the total cases of PASC, or a relatively rare outcome, while most heal. We don't know if repeated infections increase the odds of degeneration. What we do know is that the *initial* damage does happen, that it's a really common result of infection, and that it lasts for quite a while.\n\nWe also know that PASC is associated with some of the same biomarkers as degenerative diseases like the amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's. Most crucially, we shouldn't need conclusive evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to degenerative disease to want to avoid that risk. This is a massively infectious virus. Letting it run rampant is playing with very dangerous numbers. Even with a flat 20% chance of each infection leading to PASC, and a 1% chance of PASC becoming degenerative, that would still be a massive number of people newly developing a severe condition. Conservatively, 600,000 new cases each year, which is more than Alzheimer's. We don't need to know if this will happen for sure. We have enough evidence to want to avoid this at all costs.\n\nThere is literally no argument against Zero COVID other than \"I have no empathy and no fear.\"",

Booooo. On a more serious note, the production of concrete accounts for about 5% of worldwide carbon emissions, due to the burning of fossil fuels to heat calcium carbonate for making cement, as well as the CO2 released from the calcium carbonate itself as it is processed. I don't know what a good solution for this is. Concrete is the king of construction materials for so many very good reasons, and it remains to be seen if any sustainable alternatives can supplant it.\n\nI'm not well-versed in this field, so if you have insights, I wanna hear them!",

        "smushed_text": "This is what \"abolish the family\" actually means. The bourgeois family form is explicitly constructed to abrogate community and replace it with secluded, patriarchal, easily-modulated units of social reproduction. https://t.co/kFBWJNheZa The role of the nuclear family is to alienate you from the vast breadth of support and input to which you are entitled as a privilege of social life. You become inured to the notion of being wholly dependent on yourself and the whims of a tiny group of family members. Communal life is relegated to \"appropriate spheres,\" easily filtered through the various lenses of explicit and implicit hegemonic control, thereby subverting the organic social recombination through which cultures naturally evolve. Your values, sensibilities, skills, cultural expressions, conceptions of the world around you, and especially ability to coalesce into political formations are constrained into these tiny reproductive units. Your social horizon becomes the walls of your nuclear home. Rebellion in any form is heavily suppressed under the bourgeois family model. Without that communal interplay, you are likely to retain and reproduce the ideology and standing of your parents, who did the same with their parents. You carry forward their class position, their religion, their culture, their political allegiance, their deference to hegemonic structures, and of course, their instinct to uphold the exact same social reproductive model as superior to all others. This is one of the many ways bourgeois hegemony maintains itself. The nuclear family is a potent force for social protectionism, conserving the dominant ideology, even to the detriment of its working class adherents. You are trapped, both materially and ideologically. This is where the deliberate construction of working class ideology comes into play. We build explicitly ideological organizations to bridge that economic-cultural gap between \"nuclear\" islands. These organizations must span all spheres of social life, superceding the extant \"appropriate\" areas of social interaction: workplaces, schools, religious spaces, community associations, recreation, etc. True working class orgs are omnipresent and available to the entire class. \"Community\" feels like a natural, organically arising phenomenon, emerging out of the fertile soil of unplanned social interactions between neighbors. And to some extent it is. But in practice, that soil has been depleted by bourgeois culture. It must be replenished. Members of the community must first see themselves as part of a collective while, engaged in shared material struggle. This is where the organization comes into play. It creates the framework for folding natural collegiality into an overarching project: an ideological movement. We \"abolish the family\" when we create the conditions for every member of the working class to see their entire community as their family. You are surrounded by your friends, your comrades, your cousins, your elders, your children. Your class is your community.",

It's hilarious to be called idealistic over this, when we're actually being extremely pragmatic. We have a very specific goal in mind -- ending genocide -- and we're trying to find ways to achieve it. As has been made abundantly clear, elections have nothing to do with that goal. The same is true for every other one of our aims, both large and small. On any given issue, from climate change to immigration to housing to policing to queer liberation to healthcare and so on, both parties rush to show us that there is *no way* to achieve our aims using them. We've been told our whole lives \"Well that's only because your aims are unrealistic.\" And maybe that has worked for some people, on some issues. But when you start telling people \"Ending genocide is unrealistic,\" something starts to click. We have reached a turning point. Yes, there are still plenty of people for whom even this -- even GENOCIDE -- is another thing they should just settle for. But for a growing number of people, this is the Rubicon. No turning back, no returning to the fold. You can't undo \"elections can't end genocide.\" That notion is now permanently lodged in the brains of everyone who cares about genocide. An indestructible seed of doubt. Even among many who will still drag themselves to the polls, continuing to reflexively go through the motions, the ritual has lost its meaning. It'll still take work to disentangle the Gordian knot of liberalism from their minds. It'll take intensive education to convince them that bourgeois hegemony is not just fundamentally opposed to our aims and values, but is actually *possible* to defeat. But the crack is there. Now is the time to finally *begin* the war of position. A critical mass of people is now willing to be educated. We are beyond petty economism, and can now pry open that cracked facade to reveal the truth of imperialism, and the necessity of revolution.",

Markets PRECEDE capitalism. Markets CREATED capitalism. Markets are the primordial swamp in which those who are best at advantaging themselves accumulate social power. Capital depends on markets to exist, so it uses its power to violently and culturally enforce markets. Markets drive imperialism, create starvation, inflict abject poverty, foment national and racial enmity, trigger crises of production, and--most crucially--allow a tiny minority of parasitic capitalists to gobble up our world while belching out toxic fumes that destroy us all. A society that works to eliminate markets is clearly socialist. Without markets, capitalism withers. The greatest failings of socialist experiments have always been in reintroducing markets. The workers' relationship to the means of production is of critical importance. But the key is that the existence of markets is the fundamental driver of the lopsided relationship to production we currently see. And on a global stage, it's what stops the emergence of communism. We can seize the means of production all we want. Workers across the entire planet could seize the means all at once, divest every capitalist of their power, and disintegrate every state. But if markets persist, new capitalists will inevitably emerge.",

        "smushed_text": "I feel like I should clarify something for some of my new followers:\n\nYou will often hear me decry \"liberals\" and \"liberalism.\" You may very well consider yourself a liberal, because you are not a conservative, but that is not the political framework I'm coming from. Liberalism is a distinct political ideology that emerged hundreds of years ago, and can be summed up as the ideology of the bourgeoisie. It is primarily concerned with the rights of the individual as having primacy over the rights of the community -- especially property rights. Liberalism rose to prominence in Europe during the protracted, messy, violent period of transition from feudalism to capitalism. It helped the ascendant bourgeoisie coalesce into a political class with coherent goals, strategies, tactics, and identities. They built nation states, established constitutions, purged the old aristocratic classes, and deeply ingrained newly-hegemonic cultural norms. As European colonialism ramped up, liberalism came to dominate the planet. To this day, liberalism predominates. It is hegemonic. \"Conservatism\" on the other hand, is not a distinct political ideology, but rather an *orientation*. It is characterized by reaction, the desire to preserve the existing social order, or return to a mythologized perception of a social order that has been lost. In the beginning of the conquest of liberalism, it was a progressive ideology, seeking to overturn the existing social order, often through violence. Now that it has *become* the existing social order, liberalism has necessarily become a conservative ideology. There are, of course, many strains of liberalism: political factions that have emerged out of various countervailing tendencies within the overall hegemony, each vying for dominance. What you think of as \"conservatism\" is one of them. \"Progressivism\" is another. The different strains of liberalism are all conservative at their core, just with different ideas about *how* to preserve bourgeois society. While I am *less* disgusted by the strains that are *less* hostile to my existence, I'm still fundamentally opposed to liberalism *itself*. So, even though I rail against liberals all the time, don't be offended. I'm talking about the entire liberal, capitalist, imperialist hegemony. Even if you identify yourself as \"liberal,\" there is probably a very good reason you followed me in the first place: you dissent. You refuse to be complacent. You are NOT conservative. You want to see a fundamental shift in the way society works. And on that, we agree.\n\nOf course, there is much more to building a political movement than just agreeing that we want change. I'm a communist: specifically, a Marxist-Leninist. If you stick around, it'll become very clear exactly what that means and why I embrace that ideology. I don't care if that's not *your* ideology, as long as you refuse to be complacent, are always growing, and are ready to fight.",

        "smushed_text": "There is a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of money in the public psyche. We tend to think of money as a useful abstraction for exchange: bartering made universal.\n\nIn fact, this is how money started. But over time, money-as-exchange was replaced with money-as-capital. Money-as-exchange was invented to simplify trade. Rather than directly trading commodities for other commodities--for which individuals may have varying use--one could simply exchange commodities for money, which could then be used to purchase a variety of other commodities. For example, rather than producing 20 bushels of grain and then hauling it around, trying to find people willing to exchange grain for lumber, baskets, tools, etc., you could exchange all of it for money, and purchase whatever you needed whenever you needed it. This abstraction represented a clearing of the way for exchange *in and of itself*. Money-as-exchange meant you could *purchase* use-value (food, housing, tools), rather than producing it yourself, or producing something that could then be exchanged for what you need. In the early days, this wasn't much of a problem, since the primary way you acquired money was through... selling the products of labor. Production was still necessary to get money.\n\nOf course, there were already cracks in the \"purity\" of money-as-exchange from the beginning. The most obvious failing was of course, that the production didn't need to be *your* production. You could use force or manipulation to steal or swindle money or commodities from those who actually produced it. This was already happening long before money, but money sped it up. A corollary of money-as-exchange not requiring *your* production was that it allowed the explosion of merchants: people who use money to purchase commodities, then sell those same commodities for more money than they spent, without adding to their use-value. A new class of people emerged who, without producing anything, managed to still acquire money (and therefore purchase what they needed to survive).\n\nAt the start, this was not a problem. Merchants served a role in society. They didn't produce, but they did aid production. Those who *did* produce could easily and reliably exchange their commodities to merchants, purchase commodities from other merchants, and thereby quickly return to production. In other words, money-as-exchange and merchants removed some of the friction involved in REproduction. This reduction in the friction of exchange meant more labor could go toward production of necessities, and therefore more surplus. More surplus (abstracted through money) meant more labor could be invested into *advancing* production (producing tools, innovating technology, etc.) However, crucially, merchants could advance their money-making MUCH more quickly than those who actually produced the commodities they bought and sold.\n\nIf the profit from one buy-sell cycle was 10%, that meant the merchant could then buy 10% more commodities in the next cycle. If, in that same cycle, the actual *producers* only advanced their commodity production by 5%, then the \"advancement\" of the exchange power of money has therefore doubled the actual advancement of production. In 17 years, the merchants' investments will have yielded a 5-fold return, while actual production only doubled. Where before, a single merchant might have purchased (and sold for profit) the products of a single farmer's labor, now he could do the same with TWO farmers. Already, money-as-exchange starts to morph into something new. Without producing anything, a single merchant is accumulating value from the productive labor of two people, something that would not be possible otherwise.\n\nAnd it gets much worse. With this additional money, the merchant can do much more than purchase commodities for resale. He can hire workers to sell the goods on his behalf. He can purchase land on which production can be done exclusively on his behalf, thereby eliminating the need for purchase. He can hire security forces to protect his holdings, or even violently seize the holdings of others. He can levy rent for others to do their normal production on his land.\n\nAll of these--and more--are the result of his money becoming something more than an exchange medium. This is money-as-capital.\n\nThe capitalist's money can be used in a variety of ways, not just to purchase commodities for his own use or to boost production, but to seize more and more control of the production that already exists independently of his influence. The more the capitalist invests his money into buying production over simply purchasing commodities, the more of his money transforms from a simple abstraction of exchange, into the purpose for which the exchange happens in the first place. The production *itself* is meaningless to the pursuit of money-as-capital. If the capitalist could find a way to simply use money to purchase more money directly, he would. And in fact, that is the origin of finance capital, which is a topic for another day.",

        "smushed_text": "You want \"nuance\"? Ok, here's my nuanced take on the matter of civilians.\n\nFirst: Israel doesn't give a shit about that. They slaughter Palestinian civilians for sport. They barely even care about *their own* civilians. Military service is obligatory. They hate civilians. Second: If you made the decision to move to an active occupation, because you were told it's your ancestral right, and your presence is necessary for creating a Jewish state, you are a blood and soil fascist. You are not a civilian. Leave immediately if you regret that decision. Third: If you were born in \"Israel\" or brought there as a child, you are obviously not culpable for your presence there. If you grew into an adult, and somehow missed the fact that your *continued* presence there is an act of military occupation, that is called willful ignorance. Not everyone currently being used as a pawn of the occupation is there willingly. The goal of ending the occupation does not necessarily involve mass immediate deportation of people who have known no other home. But the fact remains that the Zionists ARE using innocents as pawns. Fourth: There's no way for the resistance to distinguish between noncombatants who are there deliberately and those who are there by circumstance. They're specifically targeting military infrastructure, but BY DESIGN, Zionists have set up civilians as part of that infrastructure. The outrage being drummed up around \"violence against civilians\" IS THE ENTIRE PLAN. The Zionists put those civilians there for this exact purpose, as they have done for decades. They have invested billions into propaganda and recruitment of a constant stream of new settlers. For decades, they have blatantly ignored every international call for an end to the expansion of illegal settlements, knowing that no one would actually stop them. And once they had people there, they could cry foul at any attempt to chase them out. That is the role of \"civilians\" in this conflict. Every single civilian death is on the heads of the Zionists. Not because they \"provoked\" this violence through repression, but because the entire Zionist strategy revolves around fostering an entire population of human shields.",

Although I would currently call these claims unconfirmed, Israel *has* used white phosphorus in the past: both in 2014 and in 2008/2009. While the use of white phosphorus itself is not a war crime -- despite the efforts of numerous human rights groups -- its use in civilian populations absolutely is. And it is one of many war crimes Israel has blatantly violated for decades, with absolutely no repercussions. Instead, it has been rewarded with a limitless supply of weapons, logistical support, and cash from its eager overlord, the USA. Not only does it receive annual gifts in excess of the GDPs of small countries, but every war crime seems to entice billions more in capital investment The efforts to smear the resistance as \"violating human rights\" are laughable in their sloppiness -- utter fabrications, while Israel's grotesque history of war crimes is universally confirmed. \"International law\" is not a real thing: it's only applied to the enemies of the west.",

Particularly in the way my \"fellow progressives\" would talk about prison labor as just another  bad policy in need of reform. I heard everything from \"inmates should be paid at least minimum wage\" to \"private prisons shouldn't be a thing, it should all be state-owned\" to \"we need to end drug war sentencing policies,\" etc. All of it focused around pressuring the state to ease up on the harshest policies. I think that was my first experience of \"wtf are you liberals yapping about??? This clearly can't be reformed.\" I could see with my own eyes the way the prison system was explicitly designed to ravage entire communities -- and it was obvious *which* communities were the targets. It doesn\u2019t take much digging to learn that the amount of revenue generated by prison labor is orders of magnitude less than the amount the US spends on policing, trying, and imprisoning. The prison population is 100 times smaller than the total labor force. The prison system is structurally incapable of ever hoping to be \u201cprofitable,\u201d in the same way that the US military is not profitable. It\u2019s not meant to be \u2013 even if the state funnels its money through capitalist firms to allow *them* to profit off fascism. The reservation system isn\u2019t designed to turn a profit. Migrant detention centers aren\u2019t designed to turn a profit. Nazi labor camps weren\u2019t designed to turn a profit. Killing and cutting off the hands of Congolese slaves wasn\u2019t designed to turn a profit. We call this systematized brutality \u201cterror.\u201d\n\nDepending on the context, you might specify \u201cstate terror,\u201d \u201cwhite terror,\u201d \u201cmass terror,\u201d etc., but the key feature to pay attention to is the use of force to repress and fracture resistance. Terror in and of itself is a value-neutral term. You can use terror to crush revolutionary organizing, or you can use terror to crush *counter*-revolutionary organizing. You can use terror to conquer and enclose land, or you can use terror to liberate it. Understanding the role of terror in establishing, maintaining, and overthrowing hegemonic structures is crucial to building a coherent ideology that is capable of accomplishing any real, society-wide objectives. The bourgeois-led imperial regime under which we live has developed its mastery of terror to such a staggering extent that it can wield it equally as easily as either a sledgehammer or a scalpel. It has such a hegemonic grip on the culture that this terror is seen as the default. In the Americas, the terror began almost the instant settlers arrived in the hemisphere. As colonies began to be established, terror was used to encroach on every corner of the \u201cnew world,\u201d killing, maiming, and enslaving the populations of three continents. In the process of establishing this massive abattoir of capitalist production, an increasingly sophisticated system of terror was developed. It was \u2013 and is \u2013 an impressively scientific approach to mass repression, complete with experimentation, data analysis, and peer review. Prisons, and the \u201ccriminal justice\u201d system writ large, are a key component of the reproduction of this terror, replacing more primitive methods like frontier justice, lynch mobs, and slave patrols. Although they still exist, they are now incorporated *into* the modern framework. (For more in-depth analysis on the interplay between systematized \u201claw enforcement\u201d and extrajudicial fascist organizing, you can check out this article I wrote for the Red Clarion a while back: https://t.co/s4dqdJZIyT) Forays into a more scientific application of terror to ghettoize and immiserate the nationally oppressed \u2013 such as redlining, segregated schooling, and various methods of disenfranchisement \u2013 were deemed too vulnerable to counter-organizing, and reworked to be less explicit. To this day, those same repressive tactics remain in force, but without even needing to spell it out for people. On every metric of social well-being, from health outcomes to education to nutrition to housing security, segregation is alive and well, and is strictly enforced. By releasing themselves from explicitly defining their operating terms, these more \u201cneutral\u201d methods of oppression are able to be applied flexibly and liberally, to an ever-expanding precariat, without as much risk of inciting organized resistance. The terror becomes invisible. And to be clear, it is still terror. Most of the death and disease and dismemberment and the resultant despair have simply become \u201cnegative externalities,\u201d the unfortunate byproducts of a system \u201cin need of reform.\u201d In truth, the system is working exactly as intended. Every death and injury from exposure, malnutrition, lack of healthcare, gendered violence, overdose, infrastructural collapse, natural disaster, and more is a weapon wielded by a terroristic regime that has fine-tuned its operations. The despair drives expropriation. The regime is predicated on this simple logic: enrich the bourgeoisie and you will be rewarded. Fail, and you will perish. This logic is pummeled into the minds of the labor aristocracy and oppressed peoples alike through the use of both passive and active terror. The former group is instinctively drawn to defend bourgeois hegemony: they see the terror visited upon the latter group and are either grateful to avoid it, or see it as the \u201cjust punishment\u201d for some imagined failing. The latter, meanwhile, is violently crushed into submission. (In case it wasn't obvious, instinct is not destiny, and it remains within the power of any individual to overcome their class instincts and become a revolutionary.) \u201cCriminal justice,\u201d then, is the most visible way of simultaneously affirming the class instincts of the Elect and reminding the oppressed that they have no right to rebel. They are barred from even the \u201cright\u201d to enrich their oppressors, and brutalized for this \u201cdefiance.\u201d The national and gender oppressed are relegated to a systematic failure to meet their rubber quotas, and have their hands cut off by a mechanized terror apparatus. This is the role of prisons, and it is worth infinitely more than the piddling profits made off slave labor. (While I have your attention, I highly recommend checking out @probablykaffe, who consistently has great insight to share on this and related topics.)",

But in doing so, they would be forgoing many MANY billions more. This means that the amount of profit they make as a function of the capital invested falls drastically. Imagine you have a million dollars to invest. One company is pumping out profits at such a high rate that you predict that in 5 years, you will double your investment. Another just sacrificed 75% of its profit rate, and you can expect 15 years to double your investment. Now repeat this thought experiment for all 4,000,000 outstanding Ford shares, all 1,400,000 outstanding GM shares, etc. Why would any shareholder continue to keep their capital tied up in the less-profitable enterprises, when they could easily switch? The danger isn't even just other enterprises within the same industry. The rate of profit internal to a particular sector naturally tends to decline as labor-saving technological innovations permeate the industry (a topic for another day), and investors start to divest. Basically, these companies aren't just being greedy: they're engaged in an existential struggle. This struggle goes on every day, throughout the entire capitalist economy, and it drives increasing exploitation. This is why we can never be satisfied with mere economic concessions.",

I literally said you DON'T need calculus to understand what's going on.\n\nThe response by liberals has been indignantly trying to inject MORE math into the situation -- a *social* situation they want to explain away. https://t.co/uiyxxl1osE Every part of the red area, people are thinking \"My rent is higher than it was, and I don't like that.\"\n\nEvery part of the green, they're thinking \"My rent is only slightly lower than it was at its worst, which was already way too high -- and it's STILL too high.\" It's really that simple. People haven't been tricked by social media into hating something good. They haven't been let down by their lack of understanding of statistics and economic trends.\n\nThey are looking at their bank accounts and saying \"I don't make enough to survive.\" Liberals are busy celebrating the \"victories\" they have notched by searching for them in whatever subsets of the population they apply to.\n\nAnd then they get confused when the rest of the population doesn't feel like the political system has anything to offer them. You don't need to lose the majority of the country to lose an election. Saying \"Oh, but [X] population should be grateful,\" such as pointing out that most people don't rent, means you acknowledge your system doesn't serve everyone. And they admit this all the time. \"Of course costs of living are increasing! They always do! But so do wages!\"\n\nExcept we already know that wages don't rise fast enough to meet rising costs. The BEST liberalism has ever offered people is a shift in that balance, where wages aren't outcompeted *as much*. Hidden by those broader trends -- which are still depressing overall (\"You aren't getting left behind quite as quickly as you could be!\") -- is the day-to-day reality of the working class. Even as \"wages\" as an abstract concept go up, there is immense squeeze felt in the moment. You, as a \"prototypical working class Jane,\" see your costs of living shoot up without any increase in your income. Maybe in a few months or a year, you get a \"cost of living adjustment.\" In that time, costs have continued to rise -- maybe not as quickly as before. That entire time before your raise, you are in freefall. You're cutting back on even the tiny luxuries you used to get through the day. If you had savings, you've been eating into them. You've maybe been spending on credit, racking up debt -- and interest -- adding to the cost. Maybe your job is absolutely miserable. Maybe your boss is sexually harassing you or committing wage theft or other labor violations -- but you don't fight back, because you can't afford to even *risk* losing your already sub-living wage income. Maybe you've been in a similar situation for years, and it's only gotten worse once rapid inflation set in.\n\nAnd then Joe Biden comes in and \"fixes everything.\" Except you're still in that position. Your rent is no longer skyrocketing, but it's still way higher. Your wages have gone up a bit, but you still feel like you're treading water. Your job is still miserable, but there are \"better options\" out there. Do you qualify for them? Are they close enough? Do you have the time and energy to go looking while fighting for your life? Zooming back out, we can callously refer to the various bits of economic strain felt across the entire working class, even as broader trends theoretically start to tick up, as \"friction.\" People don't just magically see extra money flowing in -- they have to work to find it. And even when they do, they're *still* worse off on the whole than they were a few years ago. You can say numbers are ticking up, but a giant swath of the population is not feeling improvement. If they do, it's minimal, and doesn't compensate for what they've already lost. The sheer callousness of telling people they should be grateful that things aren't as bad as they could be is emblematic of a fundamental failing of liberalism.\n\n(For any liberals reading this, understand that \"liberalism\" doesn't exclude conservatives.)\n\nhttps://t.co/jodB1Oflnw People aren't just refusing to vote for Joe Biden because they think he's a scumbag. Some are: Joe Biden personally has been doing awful, unforgivable stuff, like letting COVID run rampant and writing a blank check for Palestinian genocide.\n\nBut mostly, they're just fed up. They're not buying a narrative that promises things will get better if you just keep voting. They're certainly not buying a narrative that things are *actually* better already, if you just delve deeply enough into the graphs.\n\nPeople are suffering. Stop pretending they aren't.",

Antisemitism wasn't the only instance of national enmity, but it was particularly highlighted due to the privileged position of institutional antisemitism in the history of the Russian Empire. In fact, we can actually see a direct correlation between the laxing of these codes, both in terms of penalties (down to 6 months imprisonment) and purview (language about possession of incendiary literature was removed) and the degradation of revolutionary norms. Glasnost was really the final nail in the coffin of preventing national enmity, including antisemitism. In the name of \"freedom of expression,\" the law was restructured again, to become so broad and vague that incendiary nationalism became all but impossible to police. Hate speech thrived in this era, including in media outlets and the propaganda put out by separatist and liquidationist organizations. The west's beloved \"national sovereignty\" was necessarily built on the wreckage of national *equality*. Hate crimes also skyrocketed. The eventual collapse of the Soviet Union, the dream of western liberalism, was ushered in by rising nationalist vitriol, and what followed was a new golden age of hatred and national oppression.\n\nEastern European Jews have never been safer than they were under Stalin.",

The heroic staff of the hospital vowed to continue their medical duty. The resistance has made clear that, strategically and militarily, the hospital is unimportant. The IOF's storming of it is simply a desperate act, reflecting their inability to achieve meaningful military objectives in the face of a humiliating defeat. The bloodthirsty IOF continues its assault, in light of the dozens of martyrs that have ascended in the courtyards and halls of Al-Shifa Hospital.\n\nThis futile attempt to undermine resolve should be understood by the Palestinian people and allies... ... steadfast in the face of this aggression; it will only strengthen the determination to resist.

        "smushed_text": "An often overlooked aspect of world imperialism is the disempowering conveyor belt of international logistics. Its purpose is to alienate to the extent possible, the natural source of raw materials from the various steps of production, and to distance production from consumption. The vaunted Supply Chains\u2122\ufe0f of these commodities are a product, not of the \"efficiency of the free market,\" but rather its unique ability to extract profit from ever-shrinking gaps. It abstracts and obfuscates production, separating each stage into opportunities for exploitation. Global logistics is a 9 trillion dollar industry, expanding at a rate much faster than the rest of the global economy. It is projected to double in value over the next ten years, largely due to advances in automation and computing power. The strength of the logistics industry comes from its ability to displace inputs and outputs of each stage of production, driving down the prices of resources and labor for every new capitalist that wants a piece of the pie. It physically alienates workers from their products. The end result is that workers at each stage are disempowered, forced to act as producers of intermediate commodities, rather than retaining even a shadow of agency. They cannot easily seize economic control over production, because the majority of production is an ocean away. Take vanilla as an example. The vanilla plant is native to Mexico, where a certain bee species co-evolved with it to act as its sole natural pollinator. However, the vast majority of vanilla is grown in Madagascar, where labor-intensive hand pollination must be employed. Once harvested, the vanilla beans typically undergo only one step of the production process -- drying -- before being packaged and shipped off. Local farmers sell their product for a few dollars per pound to logistics companies, forced to accept wildly fluctuating prices. These beans are sometimes shipped to NA and Euro markets for direct consumption as a luxury commodity. However, this niche consumer bean market is FAR surpassed by the market for further processing: natural vanilla extract, as well as the various products that use it. The production of natural vanilla extract requires the beans to be aged for months, which often cannot be done by farmers in Madagascar. Although they could demand a higher price for a more-processed commodity, those large shippers only operate and buy during harvest season. Beans are shipped to new facilities for aging and then sometimes transported again for processing into extract (sometimes these are the same facility). The largest exporter of vanilla extract is SE Asia, where the climate is incompatible for commercial-scale vanilla cultivation. Just like the beans themselves, there is a consumer market for vanilla extract at this stage -- again, largely wealthy consumers in \"the West.\" However, the plurality of vanilla consumption is commercially, in the manufacture of ice cream. Yet again, this stage of production typically takes place far away from the source of its input commodities. Most of the largest manufacturers of ice cream for the US market are actually in the US itself, although their products are still shipped thousands of miles domestically. Although the consumer market for ice cream is pretty large, once again, the lion's share of consumption is commercial; fast food companies in particular are huge ice cream consumers. This final stage of production is typically performed on-site, to be consumed immediately. At every stage of this productive process, from seed to McFlurry, profit is extracted. Every worker is exploited as more and more labor is embodied in each successive intermediate. Every stage requires precise transport and coordination of multiple supply/distribution contracts. Each step involves further intensification of constant capital, with technology being integrated in stages: vanilla extraction, ice cream mix production, retail soft serve preparation, etc. Each stage also incorporates more diverse inputs: ethanol, dairy and sugar, containers. Commodities from multiple producers are brought together at each stage, further diluting the power commanded by labor. Then, the capitalists distribute their share of the supply chain to multiple different successor capitalists to diversify and intermingle their production. In this way, modern capitalism has simultaneously driven escalating layers of exploitation and profit extraction while also attempting to make itself immune to the threat of local seizures of lynchpins of production -- by simply eliminating the need for lynchpins altogether. The extraction of value from the global south accelerates with every unequal exchange along the way. The imperial core's working class is set to work topping off profit extraction, divested from both the natural sources of materials and the vast labor embodied within them. This exposes the truth of why pure economism is a nonstarter for socialist organizing within the imperial core. \"Labor organizing\" cannot be separated from the hours and hours of embodied labor ripped from the imperial periphery to provide the inputs for a single hour of our own. To imagine a \"socialist US\" is to ignore the imperial relations crucial to our \"way of life.\" To even begin to bring about a socialist society, empire must be completely eradicated. Decolonization on every front -- land, labor, and logistics -- is a prerequisite for liberation.",

        "smushed_text": "Of all the poisons inflicted on humanity by the cultural hegemony, none is more lethal to the human spirit than the individualization of oppression. This is the lesson we relearn every moment in this toxic social form: our very identity relies on giving and receiving oppression. At different strata of society, we each become acclimated to different measures of oppressing and being oppressed. Whatever that balance, we are taught to see it as natural and integral to our place in society. We are taught to rebel at the very thought of destroying oppression. We are each of us transformed from individuals--from the humans we are--into agents of the social form. We are taught not to cultivate our own humanity, but to build an edifice instead. A monument to the warped social relations we are handed. In this sense, through the reproduction of social relations, oppressor and oppressed are dehumanized. Both elements exist in us all, which helps cement the righteousness of our role in the construction of the edifice. Were we not to oppress, we would be oppressed all the more. It is from this realization that we can reckon with the source of a true politics of liberation. We must grapple with the notion that to seek liberation is deeply uncomfortable. It is a challenge to our own identities--imposed though they may be. We feel secure in oppression. Our race, our gender, our nation, our religion, our speech, our family--none are left untouched by this vital poison. Liberation must form new conceptions of these social forms, expressions which are either divorced from the oppressive construct, or crafted in opposition to it. This, of course, is the source of fascist obsession with maintaining the \"traditional\" form. To be queer, to be childless, to celebrate one's own racial or national heritage, to have diverse religious views--or none at all--these are destructive to the edifice. Immigration brings with it new minds, naive to the particular oppressive social form, and therefore more potent to dilute it through their mere existence. This is the core of the Great Replacement narrative--it is not the \"white race\" they replace, but the oppressive form itself. Thus, the project of unseating the hegemonic rule of capital cannot be disentangled from the very same cultural form which maintains and is maintained by it. Anyone who claims to value economic liberation over \"cultural matters\" is--unwittingly or otherwise--bolstering hegemony. This is a troubling concept for those in whom the oppressor/oppressed balance is more heavily weighted toward the former. So poisoned have they become by the dehumanizing engine of capital reproduction, that they cannot see what they have to gain from its abolition. They must learn to relieve themselves of the false identity imposed upon them. To see true liberation as the eradication of oppression. If they cannot, they will oppose liberation at all costs. They will abandon their anticapitalist veneer in favor of maintaining the social form. This is why we can never fall for the lie of patriotic socialism. Why machismo and bigotry destroys revolutionary spirit. There is no bargaining with the beast. The maw of hegemony gapes wide, ready to swallow whole all who fail to liberate their minds.",

Historically, not very far. They will buckle or they will be replaced. Instead, what we are seeing is the savviest of ideological actors working hard to *convert* the veneer. For example, redefining their precious myth of \"peaceful protest\" to exclude protest against genocide. The culture must change, the law must change, the Volk must change. The slow march of fascism has become a full-on sprint these past few years. Every crisis is a new exercise in how quickly liberalism can hide its nature; a new experiment to train for the ultimate crisis, for which the only saving grace of bourgeois society can be fascism.",

For the liberal, pluralism is simply another tool of keeping property relations safe from revolution. The moment right-fascists firmly seize state power, the moment genocide begins in earnest, millions like this man here will cease their perfunctory hashtags and slogans. They will report their neighbors for subversive attitudes. We have seen this play out so many times. We see it play out today, with their fingers hovering over 911 at all moments. We see it with people bearing \"In this house we believe...\" yard signs drawing weapons on Black children. We see it in endless support for the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border.

Doubting these sources amounts to conspiracy theorist crankery: people saw it with their own eyes!! - Once the claim has been presented in a \"reputable source,\" other outlets can cite it, presenting the claim as having somehow been verified -- otherwise, how could such a respectable organization have published it?? (Note that \"reputable source\" always means \"western,\" but when a Chinese or Korean or Russian outlet makes a claim, suddenly we're once expected to actually critically examine sourcing. Or just dismiss all claims entirely, because they're *obviously* making it up.) - When enough outlets have repeated a claim enough times, all citing each other, it becomes \"common knowledge.\" Asking where the \"evidence\" comes from seems completely \"ideological.\" You are a \"campist\" for entertaining the \"maybe China is not ontologically evil\" stance. - Doubting the veracity of the claim is seen as especially heinous, because the claim almost always revolves around human rights abuse. Doubting these allegations comes off the same as asking a victim of domestic violence for \"hard evidence\" when they're clearly suffering. - With every claim that gets laundered in this way, a broader narrative is further reinforced, cementing the inherent evil of these \"authoritarian regimes\" into the minds of the western audience, who are eager to drink up any suggestion that their lives are at least not THAT bad. - This narrative builds on itself. The sources need less credibility the more and more \"obvious\" it is that the alleged perpetrators are always up to no good. It took decades to get to that point for China, which needed its reputation re-sullied following the rapprochement era. (By contrast, it took very little effort to transition from \"USSR-bad\" to \"Russia-bad,\" once it became obvious that post-Soviet Russia was not simply going to fold itself into the periphery of NATO hegemony. The DPRK has *never* been allowed a moment of positive coverage.) - This all comes together in a frankly childish credulity toward claims about the US's \"rivals.\" Even as we watch the genocide in Palestine play out in real time, there are still those who believe it's *obvious* that there must be *something* genocidal going on in Xinjiang. - Any support expressed by the people of these \"regimes\" is because they're scared to dissent. Those who do dissent must have been disappeared -- because that's just something these places DEFINITELY do. And we know they do it, because we have \"reputable sources\" saying they do! In other words, the China-bad narrative is a closed loop of assigned credibility. If you believe it, you will believe the \"unbiased sources\" that support that belief. To disbelieve it, you have to also stop believing that any given outlet is \"trustworthy.\" This is iconoclasm. To even start down that road, you must become comfortable with feeling set adrift. The epistemology you have lived with your whole life has been presented as a search for \"objective, unbiased sources,\" but you start to realize there is no such thing. There is an objective reality. But unless you are omnipresent, watching everything that happens with your own eyes, you must -- at some point -- make a decision whether or not to trust a particular source of information. That decision can't be disentangled from ideology.",

It's an important part of the Trotskyist Foundation Myth. To a scientist, it is literally irrelevant whether Lenin preferred Trotsky or Stalin. The Soviet Union was not his to bequeath, and neither was The Spark Of Marxism. If the party had elected some random peasants Lenin never met, they would've been equally deserving of leadership. We can also see this attitude in the treatment of anyone outside \"the canon\" as irrelevant, and assessing the strength of an argument on how directly it cites one of The Greats, including just quoting directly, as if \"Lenin said this\" demonstrates veracity (let alone relevance). This is also why Trotskyists remain stuck in a dogmatic workerist mindset, conceiving of class and political economy solely in terms of proletariat vs. bourgeoisie, deeming all other social relations to be \"distractions\" and \"cultural issues,\" despite their material impact. For example, the dismissal of national liberation as \"bourgeois ideology\" and the idealistic belief that \"the working classes of both nations (oppressor and oppressed alike) must simply unite to defeat capitalism!\" without ever understanding *why* that keeps not happening. It manifests in their tactics as well -- that is, their tactic, singular. Like all subscribers to epistemologies of revelation, the strategy is to proselytize the Good Word, believing that if only you can put enough literature into people's hands, they will convert to the Faith. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I can't think of a single Trotskyist org that does *anything* other than write and distribute papers in hopes of recruiting new members... to then write and distribute more papers. Even the vague Leftists\u2122\ufe0f do food distribution, prison support, etc. In the end, how else would you expect Trotskyists to react to a member having their own list of Great Men? The canonical list is the entirety of their \"organizing.\" To RCI, something like this is like running a rival food distribution site or setting up a competing tenants union. \"I actually kinda like Stalin and Mao\" is the Trotskyist version of adventurism. The party decided on a course of \"action\" (scapegoating Stalin) and the individual is deciding to take a different \"action\" (posting otherwise on Twitter).

        "smushed_text": "The reason Marxists seem \"dogmatic\" to liberals is because we present ourselves with the confidence of those whose theories are empirically demonstrated. The same way a creationist would view me as a \"dogmatic evolutionist,\" simply because I won't change my mind on a proven fact. To them, having an ideology is seen as almost *sinful*. They throw it around as a slur: \"Oh, you can't trust them... they're ~ideological~!!! \ud83d\ude31\"\n\nThey fail to recognize liberalism as an ideology; it's just \"common sense.\" Just like creationism was once \"common sense.\" But the theory of evolution has been born out in the real world, time and time again. Every biological phenomenon is explained much better through the model of evolution than the model of creation. Evolution as a theoretical framework is able to correctly predict natural events. Liberalism is dogmatic. It mystifies phenomena and naturalizes the existing state of affairs as eternal, immutable, and causeless. History, to a liberal, is a list of bullet points: events in a sequence, with no underlying reason beyond \"that's how it happened to play out.\" At best, they acknowledge factual events, like a moving object occupying multiple distinct positions over time. They fail to accurately predict changes in velocity, because they don't believe in forces, let alone understand what those forces are, or how they change. At worst, they come up with false descriptions of the object's past positions, extrapolated backwards to fit their faulty model. They instinctively believe \"researchers\" who fabricate data for ideological purposes, because they don't believe liberalism can even *be* ideological. A theoretical model like Marxism is dogmatism to them, because it does not \"accurately\" predict the falsehoods they believe because of *their* dogmatism.\n\nSo we arrive at an impasse, where they cannot conceive of needing to update their worldview -- because of their worldview! When we assert that these falsehoods are false, we are not just presenting new data for them to investigate: to a liberal, we are committing a grievous sin. The claims cannot be investigated, because the falsehoods are already a matter of dogmatic certainty. The sad truth is that it is largely impossible to \"convince\" anyone to let go of liberalism. It can only be demonstrated, and the results will only be accepted by those willing to accept them. Those people are, by and large, those who are the most disadvantaged by capitalism. Class instincts are not an impenetrable wall, and people CAN unlearn dogmatism -- even dogmatic allegiance to a system that materially positions them higher than others. But the more secure your economic position, the less likely you are to even entertain dissent. Evolution did not come to be largely accepted as fact through debates with creationists. Bishops who once ostracized biologists did not shake off their vestments because someone spoke the incontrovertible truth to them: their power rested on the persistence of the lie. But over the decades, more and more people were brought up in a world where evolution was constantly demonstrating its value over the immaterial vagaries of creationism. Very few were \"converted,\" so much as they were prevented from becoming entrenched in dogmatism to begin with. Despite the impression you get from watching the machinery of bourgeois hegemony at work -- the media, the intelligentsia, the politicians, the propaganda -- the vast majority of people are NOT dogmatic liberals. They are simply moving through a liberal world, trying to survive. As it gets harder and harder for more and more people to survive, the predictive, practically applicable power of Marxism becomes more and more appealing. It is the duty of those who have already begun to study to both continue to research and to teach others to do so as well. Liberal dogma is dying. It is failing to provide the answers people seek. Now is the time of Marxist science.",

You can't package up a society and stick it in a lab, any more than you could an ecosystem. But you can still make observations, study its parts in depth, and design experiments that interact with those parts to affect the whole. Marxism is a holistic science, concerned with endlessly complex webs of interactions between inseparable parts. We work to understand the world on every level we can, with clearly defined goals and criteria for constructing our theories. It is iterative, and it is rigorous. \"The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.\"\n\nAnd so we have. You just don't like the attempts to change it, because you feel the existing ecosystem suits you just fine, so you imagine us as mere philosophers.

Income does serve as a useful proxy for that interest. https://t.co/o1ymIFPyg5 Someone who owns no means of production whatsoever, but is paid astonishingly high wages, and is therefore afforded secure access to not only basic means of survival, but all the luxuries they could dream of, has a vested interest in maintaining the system that pays them so well. Such a person doesn't see a clear path to improving their economic well-being through the destruction of this exploitative system. To them, that destruction would mean the destruction of their way of life. Just like the capitalist trembles at the prospect of the end of capitalism forcing them to work, the labor aristocrat trembles at the thought of having to exchange their labor at an equal rate. Both are enriched by the extraction of surplus value -- one directly and with minimal investment of their own labor, the other as a consequence of broader imperial extraction, and requiring more of their own labor as an input. Empire acts as an exchange value multiplier for the imperial workforce. At higher strata, your labor is granted higher exchange rates: one hour to earn enough wages to purchase five, ten, fifty hours-worth of someone else's labor. The more valuable your labor is in comparison to others, the more you are materially invested in the system which maintains that inequality. Not because you \"enjoy exploiting others,\" but because you enjoy *stuff*, and the class structure allows you to access more of that stuff. Someone who's paid well enough to afford all the things they want in life cannot be motivated to revolution by appealing to their sense that they are lacking. You can try explaining how \"unfair\" it is that their boss is \"stealing\" their surplus value, but... why would they care? Nevermind the fact that part of that inflated compensation comes in the form of stock options, retirement funds invested in the market, and the ability to afford investments of their own. There are almost no high-income workers who are not also stockholders -- capital-holders. *That* is their relation to production: they are enriched by capitalism. You cannot promise them any more than they already have. All you can do is show them that the system that enriches them is unsustainable and already crumbling and hope that can overcome their class instinct.",

For the vast majority of the population, it is unfathomable for any other system to prevail. For any given political aim, no matter how petty or grandiose, liberal democracy answers \"There is an office --  elected or appointed by the elected -- that will achieve your dreams.\" When laws stand in the way of liberation, the oppressed are told to dream of rewriting the law. The working class is taught that struggle for anything other than reform through this orthodoxy is impractical, illegal, heinous, utopian, treasonous, toxic. Your options are to win pockets of \"legitimate\" power, to entreat those who hold it already, or to be deemed irrelevant. Those who attempt to rally for victory through these channels, to achieve \"radical reforms\" or \"political revolution\" are painted as champions of progress or dangerous radicals, in turn. Both characterizations are aimed at smothering the true nature of political mobilization. Rallying cries of \"power to the people\" are used to carry these warriors of righteousness to victory... by seating them directly within the engine of injustice itself. In the shadow of these \"victories,\" no revolutionary mobilization grows. All energy directed toward this project is consumed. It is lost to friction, or to maintaining the \"mobilization\" to replicate this \"victory.\" An endless pursuit of small gains at best, or more commonly, mitigating losses. This \"movement\" is thereby degenerative, not productive. This preoccupation with \"victory\" in the realm of bourgeois legitimacy does not address the core concern of accumulation. Whether capital, chemical energy, political mobilization, or any other driving force, the use of that force must both reproduce itself and generate a surplus. Any expenditure of energy that fails to regain a surplus of energy is doomed to degenerate. In the case of \"mobilization\" within the framework of liberal democracy, a constant supply of new idealists is required to expend their own energy for the cause. In other words, this is not empowerment, but deprivation. Energy spent on fruitless efforts, handed the occasional small reward to provide the illusion of progress. But such treats are nothing more than empty calories, incapable of nourishing a real political movement. They do not expand the consciousness, will, and tactical might of the mass of workers. They do not clarify the state of the battlefield on which we fight. They do not create systems of power, class unity, or political education. The rare \"successes\" do not reproduce themselves. Nor could they ever do so.\n\nThe only useful exercise of \"the power of the people\" is to expand that power -- not subjugate it to the vagaries of the capitalist political system. Victory is not handed to us by our oppressors.\n\nWe are only as free as we make ourselves.",

The liberal conclusion of that is that, if only prostitution was legalized, she could have gone to the police without fear of economic reprisal. We assert that the rape SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED AT ALL and that the precarity of prostitutes *gives rise* to this omnipresent abuse. Prostitution is not illegal because \"it's icky,\" it's illegal to deepen the conditions that allow for this wholesale abuse. But the material root is not the criminalization itself or the ostracism of prostitutes as an identity, but rather the economic precarity that precedes it. An economic precarity that is not experienced by the bulk of self-identified Sex Workers\u2122\ufe0f, who adopt a genericized moniker to simultaneously flex \"moral solidarity\" and shared experience with their precarious counterparts, while distancing themselves from the attached ostracism. It is akin to a personal chef referring to themselves as a \"food service worker,\" to evoke formal continuity with bedraggled, overworked servers and line cooks, despite facing qualitatively different economic conditions.\n\n\"Sex work is work\" erases *context* in favor of *form*. Yes, obviously prostitutes should not be criminalized and penalized for the lengths they go through to survive. But this liberal formulation ends up addressing anything BUT the material context of the abuse, by masking it within the realm of \"respectable work.\" Respect prostitutes, the way you should respect any oppressed cohort. But do not position cultural normalization as a path toward liberation.",

Second chapter starts over with a barren land -- no plants, animals, or humans. We get our first mention of Yahweh, the patron deity of a monolatristic (not monotheistic) Canaanite tribe of Hebrews. The land being barren is attributed to storm god Yahweh not yet bringing rain. Instead of seven days of creation from out of a watery cosmic void, Yahweh is presented as starting from an existing desert, using a life-giving mist to make the ground lush and arable. He makes man out of dust, plants a garden in the east (Mesopotamia), and plops Adam in it. This account is more distinctly situated as the *particular* origin myth of the early Hebrews -- specifically why they worship Yahweh above the other gods, why they are nomadic, why they claim Babylonian lineage, etc. During the compilation of the Torah, it's clear that the editors included the first creation story as a way of establishing continuity with the broader Canaanite culture over which they sought hegemony -- think of Romans with the Greek pantheon, or Christians appropriating Yule. Analyzing the Hebrew Bible (and a bunch of other religious texts) through this lens is really fascinating -- so much more interesting than just believing it's divinely written. The most boring explanation of any of this is \"God works in mysterious ways\"",

Fossil fuels also get precedence -- fossil fuel leases must go through before renewable leases can begin. It's especially heinous to present Biden as \"strong on climate,\" considering that the IRA allocates $369 billion over the next decade toward \"climate action,\" (most of which is tax cuts). Compare that to the $70 TRILLION in existing fossil fuel subsidies during that period. In fact, Biden is responsible for the largest increase in those subsidies in the past decade: a 40% jump since he took office (laundered as being \"in response to Russian aggression\").\n\nIf trends from the past decade continue, that $70 trillion becomes $110 trillion. That is, Biden's record on climate is dedicating toward \"carbon reduction\" about 0.33% of the money funneled toward fossil fuels as a matter of course.\n\nFossil fuel remains the bedrock of the US economy, and all Biden has done is scatter a few pebbles on top of that solid stone.

Capital is jealously guarded and doled out only to its worthiest scions. https://t.co/oBmhiua6RH Credit has been around for eons, and the development of its mechanics can be traced through various stages of capitalist construction. Who can access it, how freely it moves, what can be done with it, etc. It is, at its core, the crystal composite of a gestalt political economy. It's dose-dependent, meaning individuals and cohorts can be assessed on their \"creditworthiness\" on a continuum and be granted smaller or larger amounts of credit -- and therefore given more or less room to maneuver within the capitalist system. The construction of a labor aristocracy is very much an intentional product of widening access to greater chunks of that accumulated capital.\n\nThe historical trend of small business loans -&gt; mortgages -&gt; consumer credit is a trend of \"trickle-down credit.\" The more credit you are allowed to take on at once, the more of that collective pile of capital you are being allowed to wield. If capital can be considered a form of motion, credit might be called the \"instantaneous velocity\" of capital -- its movement at a given moment. We can directly track this flow of apportioned nuggets of capital through the various social cohorts deemed \"creditworthy\" by the financial system writ large, informed by its assessment of risk. Capital's chosen \"moments,\" selected as being able to accelerate its flow. And how is that assessed? By proximity to the progenitors of bourgeois hegemony. The more distinct from that core -- the less European, less white, less male, less Christian, less straight, etc. -- the less trustworthy. Even with *explicit* delineation of these social cohorts proclaimed no longer legal, their codification is sacrosanct in the eyes of capital carried forward through the lineage of credit. Who is creditworthy? Those who have held credit. And who has held credit? Credit is where the rubber meets the road, the unity of capital and culture. It is one of several permeable membranes through which social heuristics are passaged into the realm of the material. As far as the semi-joking heuristic of \"labor aristocracy = concerned with property values,\" that's simply an expression of how members of that class -- the little scions of capital -- look to expand their piece of the inheritance.",

        "smushed_text": "A few years ago, I finally got pissed off enough by this that I decided to dig deep into the literature. It's so debunked as to be laughable. The only studies that show any behavioral differences across \"breeds\" (which is an arbitrary distinction), were fundamentally flawed. https://t.co/dpsktJl33S They do *not* control for upbringing, meaning they are categorizing by \"breed\" dogs which are already being socialized differently. If you raise one pitbull as a coddled housepet and another pitbull as a fighter, the behavioral outcomes are obviously going to be different. The same is true if you raise a collie as a housepet and compare it to a fighting pitbull. The key is understanding which one is more likely to have been socialized that way. If you group them as \"pitbulls,\" you erase the *material* impact of the *social* perception of breeds. Another common flaw comes in the form of studies which survey *owners* about their own dogs' behaviors. Again, the results are skewed by stereotypes: does your collie bark at the mail carrier because she's \"protective\" or does your pitbull do it because he's \"aggressive\"? Although humans have been domesticating dogs for tens of thousands of years to create broad morphological categories (big dogs, fast dogs, docile dogs, etc.), the entire concept of \"dog breeding\" is a modern invention. Kennel clubs emerged as a hobby among the 19th century elite. These white, bourgeois idle hobbyists became obsessed with creating the \"ideal dogs,\" influenced by the Hot New Trend\u2122\ufe0f of Darwinian evolution.\n\nThey were also often involved in another sort of club: eugenics societies. With the emergence of \"scientific proof\" that breeding = fitness, these wealthy, self-styled Champions of Reason had the capital to throw furthering their supremacist ideology. They implemented policies like forced sterilization and medical experimentation on \"lower races.\" None of this should be taken to imply that supremacy, or even scientific justification was \"new.\" Simply that, around this time, a turning point was reached in the ideological development of fascism, similar to the qualitative leap in socialist thought around the time of Marx. The practical and cultural craft of bourgeois hegemony truly matured in the age of evolution. Its reach penetrated so deeply into the tenets of liberalism that it's hard to even conceptualize it. You are swimming in the waters of eugenics and don't even have the word for \"wet.\" Institutionally, every system you are exposed to under the liberal regime has these concepts folded into the very structure, like rebar reinforcing concrete. Education, medicine, law enforcement, housing, immigration, and so on. All completely wrapped up in the fascist project. Everything, down to your most basic assumptions about the way the world works -- like dog breeds -- is a part of this culturecraft. The material relations that preceded this ideological development have been continuously and deliberately updated because of it.\n\nAll of it must go.",

This is in reference to both the ideas and material conditions that predominated that period, ending abruptly during the Great War. Later thinkers coined \"short 20th century\" for the period following the war, and ending with the dissolution of the Soviet Union--again, due to a distinct global social character.\n\nI would argue differently. The \"20th century\" social order HAS lasted for a whole century. This \"normal 20th century\" could then be identified as beginning with WWI, continuing through the various geopolitical struggles between capitalism and socialism, the neoliberal evolution of capitalism in a post-Soviet world, and concluding... Now. The onset of the pandemic is a very clear demarcation of the ushering in of the next stage of history. The way states around the world have reacted to this society-warping force has both altered the material conditions and exacerbated geopolitical shifts already in progress.

Health is not just part of our mission: it IS our mission. The fundamental nature of the struggle for liberation is the struggle for wholeness of body and mind. We can only achieve this by destroying the social structure which profits by our diminishment. If you can't see the convergence of COVID with decolonization, with anti-imperialism, with national liberation, with queer liberation, with climate change, with the abolition of capitalism... If you can't see how all of these are one struggle, I could never hope to convince you.",

        "smushed_text": "Bourgeois democracy is, first and foremost, a mechanism for competition between disparate interests among the ruling class. Each bourgeois faction has its own party to advance its interests, despite their united goal of maintaining bourgeois hegemony. https://t.co/LsMMQAs4FY They tend to emerge out of -- and simultaneously help to create -- distinct constituencies, appealing to them in order to compete with each other. However, although these factions advance mutually exclusive visions of bourgeois hegemony, the fundamental project remains the same: That of capitalist exploitation, counter-revolution, imperial extraction, colonialism, and everything else that emerges from bourgeois property relations. They are each fully vested in defending the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, which requires a constant expansion of violence. No bourgeois party can be said to be \"harm reduction,\" especially as the empire strains at the seams, in the face of the expanded power of imperial enemies, the accelerating treadmill of environmental degradation, and the constant decline of the rate of profit. For those populations that must be overexploited in order to maintain the empire -- the periphery, indigenous peoples, internal colonies, etc. -- as well as those whose assimilation into cultural hegemony is deemed impossible, there is no salvation within bourgeois politics. It is primarily this latter category that \"harm reduction voters\" point to in their personal crusade to legitimize bourgeois elections, because a significant point of contention between bourgeois factions is the criteria for who can and who cannot be assimilated. Currently, trans people are the subject of this \"debate,\" with the more regressive faction declaring no and the more \"progressive\" feebly taking the affirmative. The latter camp is clearly losing, and obviously have no intention of escalating the \"fight\" in our defense. And why would they? Again, their only goal is the maintenance of bourgeois hegemony. If the opposing faction successfully demonstrates that their vision of how to do that works, the consensus will be set, and even their passive moral posturing will fade. This process happens almost completely outside the electoral system anyway. To continue the example of trans acceptance, the attacks on our very existence have only ever accelerated in the past several years -- faster under Biden than under Trump. This is already getting long, so I'll just finish up by saying that the reason Republicans attempt to restrict voting rights is the same reason they (and the Democrats) do everything they do -- they want to win, and advance their *particular* vision of hegemony.",

        "smushed_text": "The idea of an \"evolutionary ceiling\" is bunk science mixed with wishful thinking. In a sufficiently large population (say, billions of infections, each hosting trillions of viral genomes), there is virtually no opportunity for full fixation of an allele. Variation is preserved. https://t.co/Y8WVK5tqWB Any time there's a combination of mutations that confers increased fitness for the virus, by the time it has become the dominant strain, many new mutations have racked up. Even if it were to conquer the entire population, it has already diverged in the course of doing so. That was the original course of the virus, leading to the emergence of alpha, beta, delta, and omicron lineages as it spread. The omicron lineage eventually followed the same pattern, diverging as it took over the world to give rise to all its lineages that are now circulating. So far, none of the omicron sublineages has been able to completely overwhelm the others to repeat the cycle, because the relative fitness advantage of each *particular* set of mutations isn't enough to create directional selection. Instead, we get maintained polymorphism. Just like in the human population--where specific hair color doesn't confer a distinct advantage, so variation is maintained--in SARS-CoV-2, all you need is the ability to evade immunity--which is already an omnipresent feature of these various lineages. All of them can evade immunity to each other much better than evade immunity to themselves (as much as it exists), meaning the relative fitness of a particular set of mutations actually *decreases* as its frequency increases. This leads to stable polymorphism. At any time, a set of mutations could confer such a drastic fitness advantage for a lineage that it is able to overwhelm all the others and again upset the allele frequency balance. At this point, it will again spread rapidly, diverging into new lineages, and repeat the cycle. There is no herd immunity. There is no evolutionary ceiling. There is no mild strain. There is only prevention. And that prevention needs to be TOTAL, or this will keep happening forever.",

One that I'm pretty sure lines up specifically with Zionism: Jews only became \"white\" once European Jews began doing European colonialism. The persistent conflation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism kinda gives the game away. The perception of our ethnic identity as being wrapped up in a genocidal project should tell you exactly what it really means to be \"white,\" and therefore protected from racialized violence. The image of a \"Jew\" in the minds of most is almost exclusively Ashkenazi Jews--deliberately so. The ethnic cleansing of African, Arabic, and Indian Jews by Zionists is emblematic of the efforts of Zionism to be a European--not a Jewish--colonial project. The more we, as Jews, assert our opposition to colonialism, the more of a threat Jews become to the racially- and nationally-sorted global hegemony. As was always the case for Jews throughout history, hence our affinity for left politics (Jewish capitalists excluded, obviously). And of course, there is still a massive contingent of Jewish white supremacists, struggling to stay in \"the club.\" But it's not working.

        "smushed_text": "\"Post COVID-19\" is not a thing. Post-ACUTE Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also known as Long COVID, is a chronic condition. Its onset is triggered by infection with SARS-CoV-2, ramping up after the ACUTE phase has passed. The damage of each subsequent infection is cumulative. https://t.co/AhMirVvtPK The framing of this disease as \"post-COVID\" is not accidental. It is carefully curated by public relations experts. Attempts to rhetorically distance the disease from its cause are nothing more than a cynical exercise in exonerating the perpetuators of this mass disabling event. PASC is an inconvenient phenomenon for the ruling class. In their effort to erase COVID as a locus of working class mobilization, they have promulgated eugenicist rhetoric to foster an individualist \"survival of the fittest\" mentality that breaks apart working class cohesion. The project of painting the devastation of COVID as one of the weak, the disadvantaged, the unproductive, the noncompliant, the \"other\", requires a corresponding narrative that exempts individuals who are \"deserving\" of an end to the pandemic. They have done this masterfully by contracting all pandemic response down to a single, optional, affirmative action taken by the individual: get the vaccine, and the pandemic is over -- for you. If you get sick anyway, you must have been weak and undeserving all along. People -- especially able-bodied people already privileged by society -- are very bad at conceptualizing their own vulnerability and precarity. Study after study demonstrates the omnipresent inclination to underestimate personal risk and overestimate capability. So it's an appealing narrative, one which has very successfully become hegemonic.\n\nPASC destroys the narrative entirely. It is common, crushing, and undiscerning with its victims. Vaccination doesn't save you. \"Hybrid immunity\" doesn't save you. The only prevention is avoidance. As the pandemic rages on, even a tiny risk of developing a life-altering case of PASC accumulates rapidly throughout the population. The effects compound over time. One billion days of lost labor become two billion, then five billion, and so on. The social strain will only grow. The myopia of the ruling class in this regard can be matched only by the willful blindness of \"the left,\" which, as a fragmented, shambling mass, continues to retreat from the cataclysm unfolding right before our eyes. When will there be a reckoning? Who will lead the charge?",

Advances in technical efficiency are always used to minimize the labor necessary for production, thereby freeing up industries to invest more into constant capital (machinery, land, IP, raw materials, faux frais, etc.) and less into variable capital (labor power). https://t.co/xc3z7bY8mz Whether through implementing less labor-intensive techniques and technologies, using less expensive labor, or moving capital from one industry to another, the goal is always to increase the ratio of constant to variable capital. In many cases, including this one, multiple opportunities for achieving that goal emerge simultaneously. With a technology that is easier to use, less expertise is necessary for production, meaning a greater mass of labor is available, and the price to purchase labor power falls. As technological efficiency increases across the industry, the amount of constant capital that must be invested to attain the same amount of profit also increases, which is untenable, and requires capitalists to remediate their losses in any of several ways. The easiest way to repair the falling rate of profit is to increase the rate of exploitation, and \"gig tech workers\" would be one such method for that. In addition, any labor that can be done at the discounted rate of immiserated third world workers will find its way there.",

It's a vital part of our survival and history. It forms continuity, a shared culture that is otherwise hastily cobbled together from scratch every generation. The nature of our role as social outliers means queer kids are almost always deprived of parental guidance: sometimes *entirely* deprived, in the case of bigoted birth parents. But even with familial support, they are still being brought up in straight culture. Children, teenagers, and young adults are already in a period of figuring themselves out and finding their place in the world. When they're queer, they must *also* navigate a dual role of outcast in one world and forging a path in the subaltern world. This latter world -- the one where they are safer and more accepted -- plays by different rules, which they were never taught. There are now many new pitfalls and dangers they've never imagined or encountered. Even adults new to this life enter with a degree of naivety. But younger people are especially vulnerable. Depending on their circumstances, they might be newly impoverished, newly isolated, exploring their sexuality, or dealing with illness. They are so often adrift and aimless in a world which sees them as prey. It's in this context that queer youth -- and especially trans girls -- are subject to astronomically higher rates of abuse. This comes not only from that now-hostile straight world, but unfortunately also from within the queer \"community.\" There are always monsters within any population, and \"baby queers,\" so new to this world and cut off from support systems, can overlook signs of danger. So eager for acceptance and exploration that manipulation feels like assurance.\n\nAnd yes, I say this from my own experience. We cannot allow the fascist narrative of \"trans people are groomers\" to dictate queer culture and sever support systems.

You solve it by doing stuff that matters to them. Bold, real action Instead, they have stated very clearly that he can't. Instead, his closing argument for 2023 is... \"Some -- but not all -- airlines will no longer charge you a fee to rebook if they cancel your flight.\"\n\nhttps://t.co/WuwyArWuw0 And you wonder why people are increasingly turning their backs on the non-promises made by liberalism.",

Even targeted boycotts of specific corporations are too dispersed to make an impact, and don't fit into the strategy they have developed. We don't have the organizational heft to *enforce* a boycott of even a single company. https://t.co/0y9FYApMgT We don't have any systems in place to, for example, make HP feel any sort of pressure over their support of \"Israel.\" We don't have regional organizations with enough pull to go to the community and say \"We're not purchasing HP products,\" and have them listen. Even with an overwhelming majority of the public in favor of Palestinian liberation, only a tiny minority of them will have even heard of the concept that HP is being targeted for boycott, or why that matters, let alone be on board with the plan. The impact we could make on that front is diffuse and multiple layers removed from the *direct* actions we have been directed to take. We would be pressuring people to pressure HP to pressure the government to pressure \"Israel\" to... voluntarily stop occupying Palestine? It's not like it's *physically impossible* to use boycotts to hamper domestic markets so thoroughly that the cartel of capitalists known as the US decides the occupation isn't worth it. Just like it's not physically impossible to shut down literally every weapons manufacturer. It's just a completely absurd prospect at our current level of development.\n\nAnd again, if we had that power, we would already have a full-blown revolution on our hands. The best we could hope for in that tactical space is a couple of percentage points knocked off HP's revenues. Of course you *personally* can and should participate in these boycotts. It's kind of a slap in the face to the resistance to just go \"Eh, but I like McDonald's, so what's the harm?\" But don't mistake posting boycott lists on Twitter for engaging in productive struggle. The best use of boycotts -- same as protests -- is as a tool to assess the readiness of your local community for deeper radicalization. They can be used as stress tests: if you can't even get people to stop eating at McD's, you probably can't train them into communist soldiers. But even that's ok! We don't need the ENTIRE community to be communists. We just need the majority to *eventually* be willing to collaborate with us. They need to see us as doing important, useful work, and prefer to work with us than the oppressors. That's another point in favor of deepening our organizational heft, rather than rushing out into \"propaganda of the deed.\" No matter the deed, imperial propaganda will always outflank you in terms of BREADTH. We need to be prepared to inoculate with DEPTH of education. If this is all sounding like a looooot of work and preparation... Well yeah. Revolution is not a game. It's not a social club. It's not a Twitter thread. It is a fundamental restructuring of social life, top to bottom. It is the hardest work any of us will ever do.",

        "smushed_text": "WE HAVE OUR ORDERS. \ud83e\udee1\n\nThere are two very specific types of operation, laid out for us by the PFLP, that we, in the West, should be taking:\n\n- Blocking the embassies of Israel and the US.\n\n- Blocking the shipments of the tools of Zionist imperialism from Western ports. I should probably mention that \"we have our orders\" is, of course a rhetorical device. I have never been in contact with any organizations designated as a \"foreign terrorist organization,\" and if I had, I certainly wouldn't be bragging about it on social media. Stay safe \ud83e\udee1 There are other actions available to residents of other parts of the world, such as blocking Middle Eastern fossil fuel exports to the imperial core. But these two tactics are what we can do from inside the belly of the beast. And they were chosen deliberately. All of these tactics together comprise an overall strategy of materially and politically isolating the Zionist regime, simultaneously raising the cost of defending it and lowering the benefits for the empire, as well as scuttling communication between puppet and puppet master. This is the scientifically-informed strategy presented to us by Palestinian Marxists, chosen because of their empirically sound analysis of \"Israel's\" relationship to the US global empire. It exists as an outpost, unable to sustain itself alone.\n\nhttps://t.co/DQRY4JOh4U \"Israel\" is a money sink for the empire. It's a capital investment that continues to yield profit, but it must be maintained with a constant supply of fresh materiel, labor, logistical support, etc., and must constantly justify its value to empire with a return on the investment. The order to focus on embassies is designed to hamper coordination and negotiation between empire and subject -- every subject. In the Middle East, the goal is to cut off the US and \"Israel\" from collaborationist governments and drive an end of normalization. This drastically diminishes the gains made by the empire for having its colonial outpost. (It also lays the groundwork for further revolution by the working classes of those nations to end the collaborationist regimes -- something \"Israel\" has consistently aided in averting.) Similar goals are accomplished by the blockading of oil exports, but in a more immediate, acute style. A war on multiple -- but not every -- front, as the international resistance builds organizational and tactical maturity.\n\nFor us in the imperial core, the tactics are flipped. We are the ones positioned to attack the propping up of \"Israel,\" again, through the ports and the embassies. Where the Arabic resistance is directed to drive down the benefits of empire, we are directed to drive up the costs. That requires very targeted, coordinated operations. The emphasis on the *shipment* of weapons and other tools of empire, and not the manufacturing, is deliberate. The empire has limitless facilities for the manufacture of military tech. Most production has nothing to do with \"Israel,\" and is not in the purview of this campaign. It would be nice if we could simply shut down every facility, scuttling the entire military industry, but we aren't even *close* to having that capability. We can't even properly shut down ONE! If we had the ability to shut down production, we'd already be engaged in revolution. Shipment, however, is targeted. It's a lot simpler to plan and execute a blockade operation. It's still difficult, and still requires depth of organization many of us currently refuse to learn. But it is absolutely within the capacity of our nascent movement to learn to do it. Every shipment departs from a specific choke point and has a specific destination. By the time ships begin getting loaded up, we can already *know* where the weapons are headed. If they're headed for the occupation, they're a productive target. Our purpose in engaging with this campaign is not to act as mild nuisances, flies for the empire to swat down. We need to be regimented, a fighting force that consistently drives up the cost of empire, in coordination with the rest of the international resistance. We cannot achieve this with sporadic, ill-prepared adventurism that goes against the strategy of the campaign planned out by our comrades in the PFLP. We should not presume to know better than them, the ones practiced in revolution: treat them as your commanding officers.",

Of course, we shouldn't judge the efficacy of particular actions by whether or not everyone makes it out unscathed. We shouldn't be paralyzed by fear of losses. In revolution, there will always be failed operations, casualties, captives taken, collateral damage, and so on. But those losses can both be assessed by central command structures to improve their practice in the future and can be judged within the context of a series of other coordinated operations, many of which will succeed. Without that central organization, loss is just loss. The \"tactic\" of losing on purpose was never meant to help us gain experience so we could update our strategy and build new successes. It was always informed by ideological commitment to entreating (and maintaining!) the power structures that rule our society. And no, I'm NOT accusing the Merrimack protesters of being feds, liberals, or trying to get arrested on purpose.\n\nI'm saying that anyone telling you \"This is good actually, getting arrested is a legitimate strategy!\" doesn't know what they're talking about.

        "smushed_text": "Let's engage in a little thought experiment. Bear with me for a second.\n\nFirst, we'll have to accept some implicit assumptions presented by the people spreading this meme around:\n\n1) Project 2025 is feasible to enact as described, creating a \"dictatorship\" with no civil rights. https://t.co/5tQUTkFAcu 2) This will be all but inevitable and impossible to overcome if Republicans win the 2024 election, a qualitative shift, eradicating hope.\n\n3) If Democrats win in 2024, Project 2025 will not be able to move forward at all, and no further stripping away of rights will occur. In this framing, I think we can get at a much more important question than whether or not we should vote for Democrats: what ELSE should we do? How far are you willing to go to prevent this grim future? Are you willing to stake everything on the uncertain outcome of an election? What are the Democrats willing to do? Are *they* concerned about Project 2025? If so, what specific actions are they doing to avert it altogether? They're nominally in charge right now, and yet we're seeing mini Project 2025s being enacted all over the country. If your answer is \"Well, they don't have *enough* power to do anything!\" So what would they do if they won a landslide supermajority nationwide? What systems would they put in place to ensure the \"security of democracy\"? Do they have a plan anywhere near as detailed as P2025? For all their talk of how \"democracy is in danger,\" they're remarkably tight-lipped about any plans beyond voters running on a backsliding treadmill forever. Republicans have an affirmative vision for the future -- what specifically would Democrats change? If the ONLY plan is \"vote for us over and over to defer the end times,\" with every successive election another opportunity for fascist takeover, then how can that be acceptable to you? How could you possibly settle for JUST voting if one failure is enough to lose, permanently? Now, in all fairness, I do NOT accept that framing in the first place. The system we already have is not true democracy. The \"civil rights\" we have are not true political rights, because such a thing is not possible without the economic rights we will never have under capitalism. What \"rights\" we have are feeble, fragile, and largely irrelevant to the political machinations of the state. And even those are being clawed back anyway, year after year, no matter who is in power. Democrats are demonstrably NOT protecting the rights of the oppressed. Whether you think that's because they don't have enough power, because they haven't figured out a good plan yet, or because they are fundamentally committed to an ideology that has nothing to do with protecting us (this is the correct explanation btw), it's irrelevant. Out of all the possible ways to fight fascist encroachment, we already have empirical evidence of which strategy HASN'T worked. Why would you have such blind faith that it'll suddenly work *this* time? Aren't you tired of trying to make something work that... has never worked? The worse the possible outcomes are, the more desperate you should get. The more you should be willing to try new strategies. Whatever \"democracy\" you think we currently enjoy, why would your only defense for it be scolding people who refuse to accept your framing entirely?",

The importance of democratic centralism has been born out both by every successful revolution and by studying many failures as counterexamples. Resistance to its adoption is an artifact of anticommunist propaganda and unexamined immersion in liberalism. Of course, no level of organizational rigor could ever hope to compensate for a fatal lack of political education or the revolutionary commitment that emerges from it. None of the socialist orgs in this country come close to nurturing that education, let alone requiring it. Something I HAVE noticed is that DSA's Marxist Unity Group is at least engaged in an earnest attempt to remedy that fundamental flaw. Although I have some concerns with the particular political orientation they embody, it seems far and away the most competent programmatic effort. I will not get into specific naming and shaming here, but rest assured that this assessment is not just speculation. It comes from the testimony of current and former members of these organizations that have shared their experiences (including my own experience). I certainly don't think this problem is terminal, nor is it the only problem facing our movement. Although every problem can be ameliorated (if not solved entirely) with education. Notably: chauvinism, sectarianism, lack of revolutionary fervor, and disengagement from the masses. Whether Marxist Unity Group can reshape DSA into an organization capable of leading revolution remains to be seen. But it certainly seems more likely than attempting to form factions to reshape any of the organizations that have specifically regimented themselves *against* that. A much more practical path to building a cohesive vanguard party in North America is through political education that is not tied to any existing organization, followed by stitching together the most advanced elements from all of them.",

It's about astonishingly higher rates of homelessness, sexual assault, murder, police brutality, medical malpractice, familial abuse, unemployment, malnutrition, mental illness, suicide, and many, many more abuses. Just like every oppressed cohort, when you control for class (because of course, there are members of any given social cohort with higher class standing), queer people experience significantly worse life outcomes than their peers, due to forces that uphold the gender hierarchy. Different populations are subject to different social forces that oppress them in different ways and to different ends -- but all lead back to the same material base. Queerness is not oppressed on the basis of, for example, land, in the way indigenous people are. Rather, the oppression of queer people is an outgrowth of the bourgeois family form, which relies on the construction and maintenance of a patriarchal gender hierarchy for the purpose of directing social reproduction. This conception of family, gender, queerness, patriarchy, inheritance, and so on, was not pulled out of thin air by the bourgeoisie, and was instead adapted from existing norms for its own purposes as part of an overall hegemonic order as they dominated more and more of society. Similarly, western conceptions of gender and queerness were not simply forced upon other societies that came under imperial control, but rather had those conceptions teased out and heightened from whatever extant gender norms already existed. The consequence of which is that queerness (as a relation of bourgeois, western gender conceptions) is all but universal as a social relation across the world's societies. Queer liberation is as fundamental to revolution as women's liberation, as national liberation, etc.",

Paring it down to \"wearing a mini skirt\" is reactionary rhetoric that erases the material forces driving all vectors of oppression and the way those particular oppressions feed back into the hegemonic structure. https://t.co/xgTHvF6vFH There is not a single serious Marxist out there who thinks \"queerness is inherently revolutionary,\" the same way being Palestinian is not inherently revolutionary, or being Black, etc. What *is* revolutionary is the unity of these myriad struggles into one theory of liberation. A theory that understands and directly tackles capitalist property relations and the superstructure that regiments the world around its reproduction. These aren't disparate issues, any more than the exploitation of the proletariat is separable from the US settler colonial empire. To point to a strawman of liberal, individualist conceptions of \"queer acceptance\" and say it is \"holding the revolution back\" is to conflate those of us fighting for liberation on all fronts with our deepest enemies: the willing scions of imperialism. You cannot possibly mistake the two, because the latter is clearly not swayed by exhortations of \"holding back the revolution.\" They would love nothing more than to squash revolution like a bug. They have no relation to us -- other than the aesthetic relation of \"being queer\" And *that* is the error that is causing such vitriol to messages like this one. Because conflating ideologically and materially disparate groups on the grounds of aesthetics is a key feature of false consciousness, and is one of the central methods of laundering fascist ideology. In the wake of any liberation struggle, there are always opportunists lurking, angling for some way to peel off politically na\u00efve, nascent radicals and subvert their radicalism into a more reactionary direction. That is what political education is meant to avert. Posts like this are a mistaken attempt at exactly that -- heading off people getting peeled away from the revolutionary politics of the Palestinian liberation movement in favor of a passive liberal \"queer acceptance.\" But that's a marginal danger, one that preys only on liberals. The greater danger by far is the one presented by those positioning *themselves* as revolutionaries, and subverting the radical instincts of those novice revolutionaries-in-potentia to move them *away* from the war-on-all-fronts we need revolution to be.",

When workers form a union, and the employer enters into negotiations, the workers may walk away with a contract that seems fair, but contains this poison pill. Employers have the power to hire whole teams of contract lawyers to ensure that whatever new mistreatment they intend to foist on the workers doesn't run afoul of the contract. And without the threat of a strike, the workers have no real leverage to bargain with. In Maryland, this type of worker repression is actually codified into law for many sectors, including teachers.

        "smushed_text": "The U.S. economy is barreling toward an economic disaster worse than the Great Depression.\n\nhttps://t.co/ppU5yTJzz7 https://t.co/gz4DUUxmdK Financial capital is so thoroughly out of ideas for how to inflate short-term profits that they are willing to invest in a form of housing gambling that makes \"subprime mortgages\" look like penny slots. A ticking time bomb of insolvency. Consumer credit has long been a staple for counteracting the effects of depressed purchasing power on consumption habits: workers might be less able to afford to keep up normal spending, but with credit, they can defer that spending to a theoretical financially stable future. Even if they can afford immediate expenses, they're incentivized to use credit anyway, so they can build up \"credit-worthiness,\" allowing them to make larger purchases, such as homes. This is valuable to the lender because *enough* people end up paying interest to make a profit. In seeking profits this way, lenders always take on a degree of risk. They balance the potential of some people *never* being able to pay back their debt against the payout of those who pay them back with interest. The ideal borrower is one who consistently makes payments with interest. That interest is essentially money created out of nothing, siphoned from the borrower, who must continue to toil to pay for not only their necessary expenses, but the interest on being able to pay for them. In other words, the reason rent credit cards exist at all is because lenders believe they can make a profit on them, which necessarily comes from borrowers being occasionally unable to pay their full balance. It's a profit stream engineered around the promise of financial strain. As housing costs continue to skyrocket, far outstripping wage growth, \"I always pay the full balance\" becomes rare, which is the precise goal of this venture. The second you fall behind, your rent essentially increases by 28% overnight -- but you can pay it back over time! Until you can't. Enough workers start missing payments (say, unemployment), they get written off as losses, and institutions invested in this form of housing gambling start taking massive losses. Slight perturbations in the labor market ripple out quickly into financial crises. (This, of course, would be compounded by landlords who will have been capitalizing on the ease of making payments by raising rents even faster: \"Can't afford $3,000? Just get a credit card!\") Evictions soar, banks crater, loans dry up, unemployment skyrockets, etc. All of these things are already in the cards; they just get exacerbated by attaching interest-seeking to already untenable housing costs.",

        "smushed_text": "Here's a fun little illustration of the dynamics of imperialism: the flavor of vanilla comes almost entirely from a single compound, vanillin, which is so easy to synthesize that it can be done with the leftover wood pulp discarded as industrial waste. (1/11) https://t.co/X8rIRIlLSE In blind taste tests, participants cannot tell the difference at all between baked goods made with real and synthetic vanilla, and in uncooked applications (such as ice cream), a slight preference for real vanilla disappears when a bit of alcohol is added to the synthetic stuff. (Real vanilla extract is over 1/3 alcohol, while synthetic can be much lower, so bringing them to the same alcohol concentration removes bias.)\n\nAdditionally, whole vanilla beans are way more expensive, and way LESS flavorful than either extract. The reason \"real\" vanilla is so much more expensive than \"fake\" vanilla, despite being literally indistinguishable, is purely because of the amount of labor that goes into it. You are not paying for the deliciousness, you are paying for the extraction of surplus value. Contrary to liberal conceptions of economics, the vanilla industry does not simply invest all of its capital into the \"lower cost\" production of synthetic vanillin, because their profit does not come from \"supply and demand.\" It comes from the extraction of surplus value. If the natural vanilla industry did not exist, consumers would still want just as much vanilla -- demand would stay the same. But prices overall would fall, and the marginal rate of profit would plummet without that vast labor investment into vanilla production. When you purchase \"real\" vanilla, what you are actually doing is exchanging a small amount of your labor (exchanged for wages) for a much MUCH larger amount of labor from third world workers (embodied in the commodity). This unequal exchange forms the bedrock of imperialism. Of course, vanilla is just one tiiiiiiiny piece of the imperial puzzle. It's not always so blatant, where a virtually indistinguishable substitute can be produced for a fraction of the cost. We can't synthesize coffee or grow bananas in the global north. It's not just the final product that matters -- it's every step of the production, including the production of the means of production used in that process! Everything down to the metals hauled out of the earth itself to craft the heavy machinery necessary for economies of scale. Even if you try to \"do it yourself,\" to grow your own vegetables, to roast your own coffee, to bake your own bread, you are constantly, inescapably dependant on the fruits of someone else's labor, just in increasingly invisible ways. There is no way to avoid the exploitation. We see a lot about \"treatlerism\" these days. That's good: it's the beginnings of reckoning with the nature of the world we live in -- a society inextricable from exploitation.\n\nThere's no way to \"ethical consumer\" your way around it. All you can do is fight to *end* it. (11/11)",

I'll be pissed, of course, that another 60k people will die every year from not being able to see a doctor, and that the climate apocalypse will be ensured. But at least a lot of other people will be pissed too. Maybe they'll be pissed enough to actually break from the system. The Democratic establishment willfully enabling Trump part 2 could radicalize enough people that we could actually form a nationally-viable third party. In 2024, we could launch a presidential candidate that picks up enough steam to completely overshadow those paltry third party attempts of the past, like Green and Libertarian candidates, often perceived as spoilers. The strategy should be to focus the campaign on specific states with large independent electorates: places like Colorado and Iowa, where registered independents outnumber both parties, and swing states like PA, where even registered Dems and Repubs are more swayable by populism. We don't compete in California, Maryland, Alabama, where the establishment is powerful. We pour all of our resources into a few states that we could realistically win as a third party. And then we win. We win even a single state to prove our point. We get electoral votes and get on the map. If we do it right, we prevent either party from getting to 270. If this happens, the US House chooses the president, with each state getting one vote. This would probably advantage the Republican candidate. We'd lose another election. But as should be obvious by now, if an establishment Democrat wins, there is no material difference from a Republican. This is a party that would veto Medicare for All if it passed both houses. From there, this new third party would start winning the culture war. We'd have a chance at real, material gains for the working class. We'll suffer in the interim. But we'll suffer anyway. We've been suffering for centuries. This is a really hard calculation to make. I'm not going to be among those hurt the most by abdicating the miniscule gains we could feebly hope for under a Democratic admin. I'd be hurt, sure, but not by as much as some. But all of that pales against the cruelty of the status quo All of this could be avoided if Bernie wins. I'm still fighting. I won't give up until victory is impossible. But it's time to be real. Pair this strategy with down ballot races in the states we're actually going for, and we can actually win some seats for a third party. That will allow us national attention that could be leveraged for more competitive appeal in future cycles.",

It is an inversion of the relationship between capital and the nation, positioning the latter as a pure, natural body, being polluted by a rootless, alien entity. https://t.co/VvRxwpHB5s It identifies the enemy, not as capital itself, or any of the self-reinforcing structures it upholds, but as *the wrong kind* of capital. Capital that takes from and weakens The Nation -- as opposed to good, strong, natural AMERICAN capital (or European, Canadian, white, etc). In doing so, this formulation naturalizes both nation and capital, with the latter being an *offshoot* of the former. To a fascist, the nation is supreme -- a natural state of affairs -- and capital is just a thing the nation does, as a matter of course. To provide any sort of explanation for the very clear role of capital in the perpetuation of war, imperialism, etc. -- without naming capital itself as the culprit -- fascists propose a mythical \"alien\" capital. The problem, then, is that this capital is not \"our\" capital. They explain that, to solve the problem, we must drive out alien elements from \"our\" pure society (final determination of alienness to be established at a later date). They rail against \"transnational\" institutions -- all of which were directly established BY homegrown capital. All of this to offer a vision of \"utopian capitalism,\" in which domestic capital is a manifestation of the collective efforts of a unified, uncorrupted nation, and in which direct imperialism plays no role.\n\nThis, of course, couldn't be further divorced from reality. The vast wealth commanded by these \"great nations\" is in fact the manifestation of global exploitation. A world imperial order that makes use of an unrelenting tide of violence to cement \"the first world\" as the unchallenged economic hegemon. \"Transnational elites\" are merely one example of the infinite horizon of capitalist ambitions, but it's one that presents an opportunity for fascists to obfuscate political economy through an aesthetic filter.

        "smushed_text": "I am currently in the planning stages of building an org in Baltimore to provide people with free or minimal-cost housing by taking advantage of the glut of vacant properties. There are over 14,000 such properties, most of which are \"owned\" by absentee owners. \ud83e\uddf5 We would rely primarily on dues and labor provided by members -- as well as donations and volunteer work from supporters -- as a means of purchasing, rehabilitating, and maintaining vacant properties. We need to be able to provide them to community members without charging rent. Where possible, we may make use of grants provided by the city for rehabbing dilapidated buildings in our neighborhoods. The city has a vested interest in reducing \"urban blight\" and claims to have multiple programs in the works to address vacant properties. Notably, they want to \"utilize the private market to maximize the repair and rehabilitation of blighted properties.\" In other words, they want to sell off our city piecemeal to developers and gentrifiers. This will only worsen the economic despair of our communities. By transferring as many of these properties as possible into the control of a working class organization, whose membership is open to the public, and whose governance is democratic, we can act as a bulwark against the expungement of our city's poorest residents. We will simultaneously be able to provide stability and safety for our community -- thereby strengthening the entire working class --  while working to draw people into an organization aimed at educating and developing its members into professional revolutionaries. We will be organized under the principle of democratic centralism, aimed toward expanding our scope as we build out a Marxist-Leninist organization that provides for and educates our community in an increasingly holistic and sustainable way. We will hold community meetings and conduct investigations to ensure our actions are always aligned with the needs of the communities in which we operate. It will require a good deal of investment from our members, in terms of time, money, and expertise. This is not a non-profit. If this sounds interesting to you, please reach out by DM, and share with anyone you think can help. At the current stage, we specifically need people in the area committed to building this org from the ground up, as well as advice from communists everywhere. If you cannot commit to assisting at the formation stage, please still reach out to let us know you're interested in supporting us once we're up and running. Membership will be restricted to Baltimore residents, but we will welcome support from anyone who shares our principles.",

        "smushed_text": "Since this information is not being communicated by governments or media, here is my COVID guide:\n\nEVERY time you get COVID, you have a small chance of dying, a larger chance of disability, and a MUCH larger chance of increased stroke, heart attack, and all-cause mortality rate. Vaccine immunity wanes. If it's been 6 months since your last dose, you're not much better off than someone who is unvaccinated when it comes to those long-term effects.\n\nThis holds true whether you're young or old, have preexisting health conditions or not. Getting infected multiple times makes your chances of death during acute infection go down, but those long-term health effects MUCH WORSE. You're not \"building up immunity.\" You're depleting your immune cells and damaging your organs. Wearing a mask slows airborne transmission; it doesn't eliminate it. The longer you're in an enclosed space with an infected person, the less effectively even a high-quality mask will protect you. We are in a period of high transmission *right now*. There are so many people around you who are infectious and don't even know it, or think it's nothing more than a cold.\n\nSo in the absence of structural supports, what can you do? When in a public, indoor space, wear a well-fitted KN95 or better AT ALL TIMES. If you're taking it off to eat and drink, you're doing it wrong. If you're in a situation where you *have* to take it off, that is NOT a safe situation to be in. Outdoor transmission is not as bad because of high air flow. But if you're right next to someone infectious, you can still breathe in their aerosol. This is what the original social distancing recommendation was for: giving aerosol time to disperse before it reaches you. Free or low-cost PCRs are still offered. Take advantage of this as often as you can. The chance of false negatives on PCR are much lower than rapid antigen tests.\n\nhttps://t.co/vhHGem9m4k. If someone you shared an indoor space with (masked or not) or were close to outside tests positive, isolate to the extent possible. Get a PCR at least 2 days after the close contact--it takes at least that long for an infection to be detectable. Isolate until PCR negative. If you test positive, tell everyone and isolate for as long as it takes to test PCR negative. This can potentially take weeks, but it's *usually* within a week. If your employer refuses to allow you to stay out that long, at least isolate until you test negative by antigen test. This is the KEY deficit of government response: everyone needs the ability to isolate for as long as it takes to not be infectious. That means no fear of being fired, money still coming in, groceries being delivered, free-flowing tests, and REAL contact tracing. If your employer makes it so you can't isolate until you are definitively non-infectious, I'm not blaming you. You are the victim here, as are all the people around you being put at risk.\n\nThere are still choices you can make, as an individual. I'm sorry we still have to do this.",

Developers bought up plots of land, left much of the plot undeveloped, and built ultra-tall skyscrapers in the middle to ensure a good view. And the ultra-rich who buy units don't even live in them. The existence of these properties, held by global billionaires as speculative wealth and tax shelters, has not \"freed up market space\" for lower-income housing. The exact opposite has occurred. Real estate prices have risen in direct response to this deliberate scam. Market forces do not *ever* push for greater accessibility. The physics of market pricing work exclusively on one principle: maximize profit. In the case of real estate, there is perceived profit to be had in hoarding, but not using. Investing millions in luxury apartments is portrayed by investment firms as the most stable way to increase wealth long-term: the property will always be there, and eventually, will spike and be able to be sold for massive gains. So they buy and they hold. At the top of the heap of this hoarding, the investment itself is also used for money laundering, tax evasion, and capital flight. Billions of dollars-worth of fake value, completely disengaged from even this \"legitimate\" housing market. That is the core problem with YIMBYism. The honest actors are imagining that since developers are trying to make profit, they must surely do The Thing that you do to make profit on the market, which is to offer your product to the public and find the optimal exchange price. But the profit isn't coming from free exchange. Quite the opposite: the demand for these properties from the ultra-rich comes directly from the very nature of their inaccessibility.\n\nThe same is true at a smaller scale for other developments across the country and the world. That is the secret of the real estate game. Over the past several decades, developers, investment firms, and private mega-millionaires have realigned the concept of \"housing\" into a giant shell game with no tether to the concept of the fundamental human need for shelter. Communists understand this concept.\n\nWe don't disagree with \"build affordable housing.\" We scoff at the naivety of thinking an entity with the capital to build would willingly sacrifice the windfall of scam real estate in favor of the pennies on the dollar of affordable housing.",

To put it simply, it is the definition of idealism. It's the type of \"ideas make society\" thinking that is only applicable to those whose ideology is already enmeshed so tightly in the fabric of the political economy that all there is left to do is negotiate the specifics. The \"window\" is this context is constrained by the existing political hegemony. It is not possible to \"shift the conversation\" to such a degree that you can overturn that hegemony, because the center of that window is not dictated by \"popular consensus.\"\n\nIt's dictated by force. The \"legitimate avenues\" for putting forward these \"conversation shifters\" within bourgeois society -- electoral candidates, think tanks, advocacy groups, educational institutions, etc. -- are not neutral. They are governed and policed by ruling class ideology. A political candidate who openly advocated for the violent overthrow of the capitalist system would not make it into office. Not because these ideas are \"unpopular,\" but because that person would be barred from office, imprisoned, assassinated, etc. A string of such candidates could make the same case for revolution over and over and it would not shift the needle whatsoever. All it would do is help cement the immutability of the system in the eyes of onlookers -- because the system *is* immutable through that arena. When people espouse idealistic notions of a \"window of political discourse,\" they are exposing their *own* constrained political window. A revolutionary break with the status quo is beyond their horizons, and they will not accept a politics that isn't tied to extant hegemony. They consistently demonstrate that they cannot have their \"Overton Window shifted left.\" If our existence at their left flank can't shift *them* away from idealistic reformism, why do they believe that *their* existence at the left flank of capitalism can do any better? The answer, of course, is that their project has no horizon beyond the capitalist system anyway, so there's no real comparison. They long to be an institution *within* the system, not overturn it.\n\nOn that front, I wish them all the best. We'll overturn that system all the same.",

There is no \"Well, as long as you wear a condom in SOME situations, it's better than nothing.\"\n\nIt's \"wrap it before you tap it.\" Every time. If you don't, you are shamed. The most analogous situation would be if:\n\n- Public health agencies said \"We recommend wearing a condom if you know you have AIDS. Otherwise, go nuts.\"\n\n- 99% of people thinking AIDS is not a big deal.\n\n- Getting weird, disbelieving looks for being a condom-wearer. - Being constantly denigrated as an \"anxious fear monger, stuck in the 80s\" for continuing to practice safe sex.\n\n- Begging your loved ones to please wear a condom, and being treated as a pariah in every aspect of social life for stating basic health facts. - Local governments trying to enforce condom bans, because \"criminals wear condoms.\"\n\n- \"We have to tools!\" anytime you bring up AIDS as an existing public health threat that should be avoided at all costs.\n\n- People tweeting about how crazy and shrill \"Zero-AIDS zealots are.\" You people need to either wake up or shut up.

And of course, by intensifying it, he is also inadvertently *driving* its destruction. Like a starving man gobbling up his remaining supplies even faster, eating tainted food, getting into fights for more scraps. The more desperate, violent, and risky he gets, the faster he dies. For an empire, built on exploitation and rabid consumption, eating is destroying. There is no way for the US to grow or even maintain itself sustainably. Its very nature is to feast. All Trump is doing is trying to feed it more quickly and brutally. Trump is not destroying America. He is widening the maw of empire to swallow the world, exposing the vulnerable, fleshy innards past the dripping fangs. He's making it more vital than ever for the targets of America's brutality to destroy it.",

        "smushed_text": "Not to fall into the trap of nitpicking the accuracy of fascism, but this still literally doesn't actually narrow anything down. They didn't define what \"belonging to the sex that...\" actually means. \"Sex\" is an assemblage of traits, many of which are change during transition. https://t.co/fXYv9QUBJm They obviously wanted to phrase it in such a way that avoids contesting with \"Well I *don't* produce sperm cells, because I don't have testicles,\" or \"I literally never produced eggs, I was born without them,\" etc. They also couldn't use chromosomes, because you can't exactly karyotype in a middle school locker room.\n\nThey want \"male\" to be a coherent definition that *relies on but does not actually require* sperm. But they fail to do that, because they use \"sex\" in the definition of \"sex.\" Again, pointing this out has nothing to do with trying to \"own\" the fascists -- they don't care, and will literally just discriminate and oppress at their leisure. Try taking this spurious definition to court when you get fired for non-conformity, see how they react. The actual reason I bring it up is to point out to people who already ideologically disagree with this, the fact that it's not just *gender*, but *sex itself* that is socially constructed. There is no coherent \"biological sex\" that doesn't resort to this same circular reasoning. \"Male sex\" is the sex of someone who has certain biological features that generally line up with other people assigned \"male sex.\" Those features -- hormonal profile, bone structure, genital conformation, body mass, hair growth, etc. -- are *chosen* through our sex-based lens. They are fuzzy and exist on a spectrum: you can be considered \"biologically male\" with negligible body/facial hair, low muscle mass, a wide pelvis, low testosterone, no testicles, etc. Any combination of those factors, or even ALL of them, could apply to any \"male.\" Although the collection of various amorphous traits we associate with \"sex\" tend to correlate with each other, they aren't rigidly linked. A tall, husky-voiced, muscular woman with breasts, a vagina, and a smooth face is totally \"normal\" and \"acceptable.\" And of course, when we factor in people who deliberately *change* these traits, the entire illusion of \"natural sex\" starts to crumble. Your conditions during development, from conception even all the way into adulthood, are not deterministic, and they don't construct One Sex. The fact that these traits are \"biological\" is just a veneer applied to a social construction; these are the traits society *chooses* to care about, to the degree of sorting everyone into one of two categories (or more, depending on the society). In the same way that certain *other* biological traits get chosen as a proxy for the social construction of race -- and then others are not. Why skin color and not hair color? Why genitals and not handedness? The reason for which specific traits are used as these social proxies are not *random* per se -- they map loosely onto *socially* relevant traits (or rather, traits that were more relevant at the time of their construction).\n\nThey are used to regiment class dynamics. This is the real reason fascists have trans people in their crosshairs. Through the simple act of deliberately altering both our biological and social traits, we incidentally demonstrate that these -- and therefore other -- constructions are facile.\n\nThat, to hegemony, is death.",

SARS-COV-2 slows down innate immune response and replicates quickly before adaptive immunity kicks in. https://t.co/D52v60Oyus This means that even with the memory cells generated by prior exposure (infection or vaccination), there is still that delay. The difference in outcome between immune and naive individuals comes into play only once that adaptive immune response kicks in. If you were recently exposed, you'll still have antibodies floating around as part of the humoral immune system. But some data suggests that antibody levels decline pretty quickly, hence the need for boosters. This also accounts for the difference in health outcomes between naive and immune populations. The virus can still replicate quickly before adaptive immune response. But once that response kicks in, a vaccinated person has plenty of immune memory to draw on to beat the infection. Bottom line: unless you still have high levels of antibodies from *recent* exposure, you can get infected. That could mean people get reinfected with an old strain if it's been a long time. When they do, it will probably be mild! But it can still bounce around in the population. This article is an easy to read review of adaptive immunity in SARS-COV-2, and cites some other good papers! https://t.co/qyGULRg0oL",

They had what can only be described as a \"noble savage view of normies,\" relishing the image of a sort of urban nomad, unburdened by the \"trappings\" of high society, hopping from couch to couch, gig to gig, tenament to tenament Of course there were some in this movement who legitimately did grow up in poverty, and wrote about their honest experiences. And the rare dose of reality injected into the scene only fueled the romanticism further. It was always a fabrication. That genre was almost exclusively consumed by the \"upper middle class\" or higher, who either pined from afar or took up the garb of poverty for themselves and embarked on their little vacations. Now we have a facsimile of a facsimile. A modern trend of pining for the Bohemians.

And any gains you hope to make will be gone in an instant. By the same token, if you have intentions of just jumping right in and appearing on the streets with a dozen armed strangers without any internal ideological development or community buy-in, you are just LARPing, and you will similarly be crushed. Militarization needs to be developed as part of an organization's general political program, emerging from the mutually-reinforcing process of building trust and support among your people and materially demonstrating why you can be trusted. Any armed movement must be democratic. In the coming years, the need for this will only ever increase. Especially if you plan to build a movement which actually materially improves the lives of oppressed people -- you *will* be under attack, from both fascist vigilantism and the state itself. The ability to actually meet this violence and repulse it is a critical step in heightening the struggle to a more mature stage. Armed resistance becomes more and more necessary, and will require more and more organization and centralization. Failing to militarize means failing to progress, and relegating both your community and your movement to constant repression by those who already do and will continue to wield violence to keep you in line. This understanding marks the distinction between reformism and revolution.",

The studies looking at mask use have emphasized their effectiveness when used ALL THE TIME. Here's a study that shows that when mask use is 100%, viral reproduction in the population could drop below a value of 1. During lunch, that reproduction number is the same as the R(0), which for omicron looks to be around 3.5 or more.\n\nhttps://t.co/xnoj9uCT6h \"We have upgraded air filters at schools or added air purifiers where needed.\"\n\nKey phrase being \"where needed.\" Multiple staff members across the district have reported that their rooms do not have any filtration at all. Additionally, Consumer-grade air purifiers have not been shown to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHere is a study that showed that an industrial-grade HEPA14/UV sterilizer with an ACH of 5-10 volumes per hour *does* filter out COVID aerosols.\n https://t.co/9bq2obXCaU \"Unlike other school districts, we test students and staff weekly for COVID-19.\"\n\nParents have to opt in to testing. Speaking from experience, getting students to bring home a paper, have their parents sign it, and bring it back has low rates of follow-through. If you're going to tout your ~nationally-recognized testing program~, you need to give us data on how many students and staff members actually end up getting tested.\n\nAnd testing being conducted weekly at a time when daily cases are skyrocketing is not something to be proud of. \"Staff members must be vaccinated.\"\n\nOmicron has a constellation of mutations that have been shown to escape neutralization by antibodies from both vaccinated and infected individuals.\n\nhttps://t.co/RwiAnsjUUQ This means that even if you're vaccinated, even if you're boosted, even if you've been infected before, the antibodies your immune system produces in response to the old strains are not going to be anywhere near as effective against this variant. Has BCPSS done a better job of handling this than other districts? Yes. Plenty of places are throwing everyone to the wolves, pretending the pandemic is over, and seeing their cases explode.\n\nBut this commitment to in-person learning at all costs is about to make its cost known.",

This means that the first stage of percolation is extremely dilute... https://t.co/GaOSLBmmNi ... and it only gets progressively stronger as the boiling continues. Since you are trying to extract coffee with an increasingly concentrated solution, the extraction actually becomes less and less efficient as it progresses through the cycles. The combination of needing to reach the boiling point before the process will even *start*, plus the increasingly inefficient extraction, means that it takes a lot of time and heat to get your coffee to the desired strength. The high heat and long extraction time also means that you end up pulling out a lot of the organic compounds that normally get left in the coffee by conventional brewing methods. These \"tail\" compounds (which are a bit harder to extract) are larger and much more bitter. On top of the bitterness of over-extraction, some of the compounds that get extracted earlier in the process are getting overheated and undergo further chemical changes *during* the brew, leading to a burnt taste. Others are volatile, and evaporate off along the way. So with a percolator, you lose a lot of flavorful compounds, alter others, and extract a bunch of \"extra\" ones, compared to drip coffee. For many people this leads to a much worse tasting cup of coffee.\n\nTaste is, of course, subjective, and you may very well *prefer* that flavor. The main reason percolators fell out of fashion is likely simply the time and the finickiness. You have to let it sit for longer than a drip coffee maker, and you have to manually stop it when it reaches the desired strength. The weaker you like your coffee, the less of an issue. That's all for now! Tune in next time, where I discuss the chemistry of espresso, which uses a totally different extraction process!",

        "smushed_text": "They care because of the centrality of the bourgeois family form in the hegemonic culture -- the patriarchal, heterosexual, cisgender, monogamous, \"nuclear family\" -- which they have, regardless of any stated \"progressive values,\" deeply internalized as natural. https://t.co/pNKTtsYu6f The social cohorts ostracized by that hegemony in general are \"coincidentally\" the ones least likely to align with that model. Single parents, \"situationships,\" multigenerational homes, intentional childlessness, \"found family,\" polyamory, and more are all treated with disdain. These \"organic\" family forms appear most commonly among poor, nationally oppressed, and queer populations, by very large margins. Cultural disdain for these groups and their family models are inextricably linked. Social ostracism and economic repression, mutually reinforcing. These are the families of the \"dregs,\" therefore it is improper, beneath the \"decent folk.\" And since it is improper, the people who do it are \"rightfully\" resigned to the dregs. This line of thinking goes around and around in that way to continue to reify the \"nuclear family.\" None of this is to say that polyamory *itself* is an oppressed status; just like with every divergence from hegemonic norms (e.g. queerness, abortion, divorce, etc.), it has always been easier to get away with \"deviance\" if you're already in the upper class. But it's inescapable that the ways the most oppressed populations live their lives are simultaneously less defined by and less tolerated by hegemonic culture. The lowest tiers of the social hierarchy have the most diverse, organic expressions of lifestyle -- and are hated for it.",

        "smushed_text": "Settler colonialism involves the de novo creation of a particular national identity explicitly for the purpose of social domination of the oppressed nations -- and vice versa, the indigenous people must be regimented into oppressed nations in order to colonize them. \ud83e\uddf5 https://t.co/z3sYQCn1CC This is a superstructural dynamic which simultaneously enforces and is enforced by economic forces: rampant extraction of natural resources, maintenance of a permanently immiserated labor force, guarantee of economically ennobled and culturally homogenized consumer market, etc. The Jewish people have been a persistent thorn in the side of the great-nation projects throughout modernity, and a perplexing concept for bourgeois and Marxist historians alike: are we a nation? Where do we sit within the hierarchy? Do we help or challenge national hegemony? For much of history, the answer to the Jewish question by the beneficiaries of these hierarchies has, by and large, been to treat Jews as subalterns, a rootless people comprising a geographically ambivalent, homogenous pseudo-nation that only serves to confound national relations Hence, millennia of suspicion and oppression have followed us wherever we have found ourselves. Jews have been variously ghettoized, pillaged by pogroms, given and stripped of political and economic rights, evicted, exterminated, and more. But we have also found homes throughout. However, the national question remains difficult. \"Jew\" refers to a diverse collection of distinct identities, cultures, ethnicities, religious expressions, languages, and geographic locales. Bourgeois conceptions of a nation cannot be applied to a monolithic \"Jew.\" (Nor can a Marxist conception of nation contain one singular \"Jewish nation,\" because the economic relations that govern the social identification of any given node of Jewishness are different from any other: the Ottoman Jew and the Polish-Lithuanian Jew are not one nation.) This is because the bourgeois nation is centered around the right to land and the economic exploitation of both it and its indigenous peoples. To be a \"nation,\" you must have a set land in which you are either economically dominant or oppressed. For a diasporic people, the bourgeois concept of \"nation\" cannot apply without a national project that seeks to *create* those conditions. And of course, no one would seek to craft themselves into an oppressed nation if they have the economic means to dominate. Hence, to achieve position under a globally dominant bourgeois regime, the Zionists strove to become colonists. They aimed to erase the multifarious Jewish identities, comprised of many (generally oppressed) national identities, and find a place to be a bourgeois great-nation. But this is obviously not possible. Those Jewish nations persist, some of which are still oppressed, some of which have been economically and socially assimilated into the dominant national identity -- although there is an ascendant rejection of this by orthodox supremacists. The Zionists are not \"The Jewish nation, with a Jewish nation-state.\" They are a singular, settler-colonial enterprise that necessarily exists apart from the historical context of all the extant Jewish national conceptions. There is no amount of propaganda that can override that. And the global ascendancy of the political movement toward a more regimented national hierarchy (what you might call the \"right-fascists\") puts \"Zionism = the Jewish nation\" as our people's greatest theoretical threat. It erases the emerging REAL national relations we face. If we cannot conceive of ourselves as \"nations in situ,\" we cannot hope to face an enemy that already does. National consciousness is the first step to national liberation. And very soon, national liberation will be critical to the survival of our various Jewish nations.",

        "smushed_text": "In case you're wondering just *why* the far right is so obsessed with queer people, it's because of a fascist tendency toward what we call \"essentialism.\" It's a pseudo-mystical belief that objects--and people--have a sort of essence to them, imbuing them with immutable traits. https://t.co/mnic3QRGms This idea has ancient roots. In Western philosophies, Plato and Aristotle posited that not only are there \"ideal\" forms of objects and people, but the objects themselves are made of a \"substance\" that make them what they are. You cannot do anything to change the object. It should be pretty obvious that essentialism is a crucial aspect of hierarchical societies. A slave is not just a slave because he had his freedom stolen from him, but because of the essence of slavishness that suffuses his entire being. Therefore, slavery is right and good. A woman's role is to take care of children and maintain the home, not because that's what society demands of her, but because that is literally the *definition* of \"woman.\" For her to strive for anything else would be to deny her very essence. As so it goes in all aspects of society. The shoemaker *is* a shoemaker, due to the essence of shoemakerness. A monarch not only deserves to be monarch, but is actually fulfilling an important social and metaphysical purpose by ruling over everyone. How magnanimous! It's obvious why people at the top of the social hierarchy would be fond of this. But even people at the bottom can find comfort in essentialism. Feeling like there's nothing they could have done differently, feeling like their miserable existence is actually cosmically \"right.\" When slaves revolt, when women leave the home, when people are homosexual or trans or nonconforming in any way, they are abandoning their \"proper role.\" That means they're not just making an individual choice: they're disrupting the \"natural\" order. For those who rule over us, that is a dangerous prospect. If we stop believing in our inherent \"manness\" and \"womanness,\" what's next? Abandoning our inherent poorness? Will we rise up and unseat these people from their inherently deserved wealth? This trickles down to a subset of the ruled masses, who also demand that essentialist order. Whatever they have, they see as being essential to them. They fear it will be destroyed, just like we destroy the \"natural\" gender order. If the elite focused entirely on the \"rightness\" of the economic status quo, they would have far fewer supporters among the working class. So instead they have to focus on the \"rightness\" of other aspects of society: race, gender, sexuality, nationality, religion. So no, it's not just a coincidence that bigotry thrives in a right-wing environment. Essentialism is literally the cornerstone of right-wing thought.",

        "smushed_text": "The so-called \"Omegaverse\" is actually a fascinating illustration of the concept of sex as a social construct.\n\nAs I understand it, the specific \"rules\" are flexible from author to author, but they all follow the general theme of replacing \"male/female\" with \"alpha/omega.\" (1/13) https://t.co/MVQGaq0qLq That is, it is a speculative social order in which there may or may not be people with physiological traits our society would use to classify \"male\" and \"female,\" but these are considered subordinate, almost incidental, traits. The focus is traits ascribed to \"alpha\" and \"omega.\" Alpha and omega are social categories constructed around certain physiological traits. To my (admittedly limited) knowledge, the most salient trait is usually scent, with alphas having a particular scent that omegas pick up on and vice versa, attracting them to each other. Because it's a loose creative community, individual authors can include whatever physiological features strike their fancy -- alphas might be characterized as more muscular, larger and/or particularly shaped genitals, even sharper teeth and keener noses. Many authors also construct their version of this theme as revolving around reproduction, like in our society, with omegas (regardless of genitalia or other real-world \"sex characteristics\") being defined by their ability to get pregnant. What's most relevant, for our purposes, is the way in which these biology-associated social constructs almost universally give rise to a highly regimented social hierarchy, complete with gendered conceptions of the respective temperaments and social roles of alphas and omegas. These stories tend to deliberately recapitulate our world's \"traditional\" patriarchal societies, but assigning the social categories of masculinity and femininity based on \"alpha/omega\" physiologies, rather than \"male/female.\" In this paradigm, a doctor wouldn't deliver a baby, note its genitals, and proclaim \"Congratulations, it's a boy!\" The relevant \"biological scent\" is generally written as emerging during sexual maturity. In such a world, \"sex\" is an incoherent category to apply to an infant. It's also crucial to understand that even this fictional conception of socially-constructed sex is still rooted in the cultural background of our own world. The writers are picking out and transforming individual elements that are familiar to them, carrying forward extant themes. In some cases, this is meant as a deliberate subversion, in the vein of \"Look how silly these stereotypes and interactions are when applied intrasexually!\"\n\nI'd wager the more common iteration is simply the authors viewing reified social dynamics as making some \"natural\" sense. \"Of course, this alternate sex hierarchy is still ordered around reproduction -- that just makes the most sense!\"\n\n\"Of course the social dynamics revolve around aggressive vs. passive, dominant vs. submissive, physically strong vs. weak!\" In the end, despite mainly being used as a vehicle to explore a particular sexual fetish -- and specifically, fetishizing one of the oldest forms of oppression -- the Omegaverse almost incidentally acts as a visceral counterargument to the hegemony of sex. And THAT is why the original quoted picture is so heinous -- it just directly reproduces the *exact* dynamic of real-world sex hierarchy. It subverts nothing.\n\nOmegaverse may incidentally reify the *logic* of gender hierarchies, but it exposes the arbitrary nature of sex. (13/13)",

We see the same sparks of that incredible capacity in our existing cousins, in the great apes that we like to pretend are \"mere animals.\" They make tools as well. They craft societies and use language and educate their children.\n\nBut our ancestors made a qualitative leap. Similar traits, similar ecological strategies, similar emphasis on crafting and adapting and collaborating. Over millions of years, the quantitative tweaks culminated in a seismic shift in our evolutionary trajectory. And this happened millions of years ago. It takes an astonishing chauvinism to believe these people -- our ancestors and cousins -- were somehow \"less human\" than us. They WERE us. They invented the tools that defined us for millions of years, and used them to transcend the shackles of niche. We expanded everywhere. We thrived in savannahs, rainforests, deserts, taigas, islands, and marshes. Populations diverged and converged a million times. There are no distinct boundaries between homo species -- we interbred and backcrossed wherever we rediscovered each other, and new populations arose. We can comfortably claim neanderthalis, erectus, habilis, and more as part of our family: our ancestors, our cousins, our partners... us. When we close ourselves off to the rest of our family, we must seem so small, so young. But we're not. We are ancient. Millions of years old.

It took years from the start of the campaign to the codification of the law, in an astounding feat of democracy. Nearly 80,000 community meetings across Cuba were held, just to revise the proposed code -- which went through 25 drafts, based on the feedback of 6.5 million Cubans. As the Family Code changed, so did the public, who went from a slight majority opposing the previous attempt at codifying marriage equality alone into the constitution, to a two-thirds majority in favor of a comprehensive law -- the most progressive the world has ever seen. It establishes rights on everything from marriage equality, to egalitarian distribution of domestic labor, to the right of children to live in a loving, nurturing environment, to freedom from all forms of abuse for all members of the household, and so much more. It would be impossible to fully distill the code in such a brief time -- it's hundreds of articles long -- nor would it be possible to sing its praises enough. The law, as well as the process of its crafting and passage, is a model for the entire world. Suffice to say, on behalf of myself and all my fellow queer Marxist-Leninists, your scorn means less than nothing to us. In the quest for queer liberation, we have on our side a REAL movement that makes REAL progress on REAL issues.\n\nAll you have is vibes.",

Notice how, in this study, they demonstrate the rapidly waning effectiveness: 0% effective against infection by 16 weeks. @VancouverGordo Also notice how the effectiveness against hospitalization or death drops below 50% almost immediately, and never even hits 70% effectiveness. They keep trending downward, below 40%, past the window of observation of 23 weeks. It has been 52 weeks since I got the booster. @VancouverGordo On a population level, this is pathetic. If those numbers held, an updated booster, available annually, would keep deaths at about 30% lower than what they otherwise would be. Think about how terrifying COVID was, back when you cared: are you fine with \"just\" 70% of that horror?",

To borrow a phrase, it \"erases the very real terrorism oppressed people are being subjected to by the US empire.\" https://t.co/RmkcfbYihU Over the past decade alone, there have been dozens of uprisings that have been *brutally* repressed, using technology and tactics developed across the empire's many laboratories. Every instance of state terror across the entire empire contributes to their corpus of knowledge. Municipal police departments, military detachments, intelligence agencies, extrajudicial paramilitaries, and yes, colonial outposts such as the occupation in Palestine, all collaborate, cross-grain, and contribute to the same manual of standard operating procedures of repression. They work tirelessly to develop these techniques, incorporating what works and discarding what doesn't, all with the unified goal of violently maintaining bourgeois hegemony. Their operational strategy focuses primarily on the nationally oppressed, regardless of imperial borders. Within the so-called United States proper, that particularly includes indigenous, black, and immigrant populations. They also target the broader precariat, to the extent that there is any measure of cohesive collective identity and unity of action. If we had an organized communist movement here, we would of course be targeted with a commensurate level of coordinated repression, rather than the sporadic sniping and frankly lazy infiltration we see now. So that repression is focused on cohorts likely to *become* organized. Or, as in the case of Palestinian resistance, cohorts that already *are* organized to the stage of military action.\n\nWhen we say \"It will happen here,\" we're not moaning over the hypothetical of repression. We're stating as a matter of fact: we WILL organize. We WILL face this. The occupation of Palestine and the repression wrought on the resistance objectively *is* a laboratory. That's not a statement of selfish fear, it's an empirical assessment, necessary for doing our *own* science. They are constantly innovating, and we need to innovate in turn.",

They set the new proletariat to work forging the chains they would use to enslave the planet. https://t.co/SYRWZAlt2a Like a cancer metastasizing, capital landed on every shore, and found there new peoples to exploit and new land to ravage. Some of these peoples were feudal, some were in other modes of production. All were seen as living flesh on which empire could feast. And feast it did. Those shiny, new chains were slapped onto the ankles of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The whole planet found itself sectioned into plantations fertilized with blood, as resources were ripped from the earth on an unprecedented scale. A hundred million beating hearts were carved out of chests, dragged across oceans, and messily chewed by the ravenous beast of colonialism. Capitalism would force the urban proletariat into smog-choked slums, but not before consigning the rest of the world to an even worse fate. There is simply no comparison between the feudal system and the plantations on which capitalism has been built. The sheer scale of capitalist brutality can only be called \"less than\" by those who refuse to acknowledge the billions still subject to the worst of that brutality. Feudalism was indeed brutal and miserable, but the world was not saved from it by the rise of capitalism. Instead, Europe alone -- as well as its settler colonial heirs -- was uplifted.\n\nCapitalism enriched millions.\n\nIt enslaved billions.",

It's impossible to know where I'd be if not for the vaccine. We know for certain that the vaccines reduce risk of serious illness and death. But there's no such thing as 100%, especially with such an infectious and widespread virus. Everyone should be getting vaccinated to keep themselves as safe as possible. But that isn't enough on its own to completely stop the spread. Unless and until businesses and schools fully shut down, the virus will continue to rampage. We have missed our shot to prevent this disease from becoming endemic. We will likely see COVID resurgences indefinitely.

The thing is, I actually *would* retain my principles and I wouldn't modulate my positions to appeal to the broadest audience.\n\nWhich means I would literally be kicked off whatever platform I use and/or face actual state repression, while simultaneously floundering in obscurity. The forces that drive \"audience growth\" and the forces that drive movement building are mutually opposed. The more popular you are as an \"internet presence,\" the less revolutionary you are and vice versa. Not because revolution is \"unpopular,\" but by the very nature of the forum. This is the same dynamic when you try to build a \"revolutionary faction\" within a liberal organization, or try to use \"mass politics\" (elections, unionism, etc.) to spread a revolutionary message. In these spaces, true revolutionary theory is DOA, so you temper your rhetoric. You observe that dilution working to expand your reach, so you dilute further. You integrate more and more theoretical concessions to widen your tent, and you notch each moment of growth as a \"win,\" even as you drift farther and farther from your original conception of victory. All the while, you continue to see yourself as characteristically different from \"those liberals,\" because of your (now-distant) original conception. *You* are a revolutionary, therefore *what you do* is revolutionary. Pragmatic triangulation, rather than capitulation. And it becomes frustrating to see \"ultras\" characterize you as being in the same camp as the liberals you're trying to win over. They're the ones being unreasonable while you make progress! You're the one making sacrifices and putting in the work while they criticize from afar. Having been with yourself the entire time, you are in the worst position to objectively view your trajectory. Each step felt like a necessary maneuver to make your principles more appealing to your target audience, each version of yourself still the same revolutionary. Which came first -- the chicken or the egg? The egg, obviously. It was laid by a creature that was infinitesimally less \"chicken\" than what would hatch. Thousands of generations from wild junglefowl, each indistinguishable from the previous, all leading to the liberal chicken. It never starts as a \"grift.\" It simply has to slowly evolve or go extinct -- at least, in *that* environment.\n\nMeanwhile, revolutionary traits are able to flourish in the proper environment.

Every image you have in your brain about the Soviet Union being a dour, starving place with no organic artistic expression is wrong. There WERE hard times:\n\nEarly in its formation, when it was recovering from the imperialist intervention that nearly killed the revolution. The 1930s famine, caused by several severe droughts and too many agricultural workers having shifted to industry to compensate.\n\nWWII, which destroyed much of the infrastructure in the west and killed millions of Soviet citizens.\n\nThese were periods of national misery. The only other time the Soviet people faced major shortages was in the immediate aftermath of the breakup of the union, when shock therapy sent everything into private hands. Living standards collapsed overnight in the most significant backslide in human history. There is a LOT the Soviet Union could have done better. No one should deny that. But it was not some tortured wasteland where no one was allowed to experience joy or hope. There's a reason people today who lived in the USSR miss it by huge margins.",

We already knew that ORF8 mutants we're associated with decreased COVID severity, both in the acute phase and in long COVID.\n\nOriginal paper for those interested: https://t.co/3Q89v2Z4wQ https://t.co/KqBbiOnkZ7 Quick background: Every one of your cells has your entire genome. Different cells do different things, based on regulating which genes are actually used, when, and how. This is called epigenetics. One of the ways they do this is with histones, the proteins that package the DNA. For example, if part of the DNA is tightly packed with histones, your cell generally can't express the genes in that part of the DNA. So you can modify the histones to regulate gene expression. SARS-CoV-2 has a gene, ORF8, which we've known for a while is associated with severity--in both the acute and persistent phases. ORF8 mutants don't cause as much harm. These researchers demonstrated that ORF8 encodes a protein that mimics histones. Meaning on a molecular level, it affects gene expression in its hosts: a thing we also already knew, without knowing how.",

People could speculate wildly about where the percentages will end up by the close of polls. Huge plot twist swings could occur over the course of one day, fueling endless hype. Liberals would go NUTS for this. It's what they try to do for a few hours on election night, and it always falls flat because there's no time for actually building suspense. By the time results start coming in, everyone's done voting, so they're resigned to their fates. To be clear, I'm not actually advocating for this.

It has a lot of machines and technology and natural resources and people who know how to use all those things to make even more cool stuff to sell for more money, like computers and guns. But how does the US get so much stuff that it can use to make all those products? And how does it get so many people working to make the products for US companies?\n\nThe answer is something called \"empire.\" People allll over the world produce stuff for the US. Someone in Guatemala or Indonesia or Congo might go to work every day -- just like people in the US do! -- and work reeeeeally hard harvesting bananas or mining cobalt or making clothes. They don't get paid a lot, but they sure do produce a lot! The stuff they produce gets taken somewhere else by their American bosses: often sold to consumers in the US and Europe, or else used to produce something even MORE valuable.\n\nPeople in poor countries work really hard, get very little money, and make a TON of money for the US! Why do they get such an unfair deal? Because they don't have many other options. They can't get a better job that pays better, because all the companies are owned by Americans and Europeans. All the land and machines and technology is owned by those companies too! And the governments of those countries work for the US too! There have been a bunch of attempts by these countries to work for themselves without the money going to the US: but then the US comes in with all the weapons they built using the money they got from this unfair deal. The US replaces those governments with new ones that will listen to them, and help them make all that money.\n\nSometimes they don't even have to use war at all, and can just threaten to take the money and go, leaving those countries to start from scratch with even less! Sometimes the US gives weapons and money to other groups to do the work for them. Rebels and coups and invading neighbors will torment any country that disobeys the US. Then the US has an excuse to come in and \"restore peace\" -- by putting in the government they wanted all along! They have done this so many times that it just sounds normal to us, but it's actually really bad. So many people die or get thrown out of their homes or have their stuff taken away, just so the US empire can keep making more and more money.",

The Tanakh lists the \"7 nations\" that needed to be slaughtered to make the land a Jewish home. https://t.co/iUNctj6noK I could go on and on about the religious angle, because it's fascinating and deeply revealing about the Zionist ideology. They literally named themselves after Zion, a fortress in what became Jerusalem, that was owned by the Yevushim (one of the 7 nations), and conquered by David Prior to that, the Torah details the origins of the people themselves, starting with the forefather Abraham, who was told by Yahweh to emigrate from \"Ur Kasdim,\" in Mesopotamia, and travel to a land filled with strangers. Based on that, Jews would be \"indigenous\" to Iraq. The mythical reigns of David and Solomon (for which there is no corroborating historical evidence of their existence) is really the only \"source\" of the claim of \"Israel\" being a united Jewish entity. David finished the conquest of the \"holy land,\" and crafted the United Kingdom. Oh, you don't want to use religious texts as historical pretext? Ok, how about the actual archaeological record, in which \"Israel\" is not mentioned before 3500 years ago, and yet some of the oldest permanent settlements in the world are found in the Levant? Solomon then ruled wisely over the pan-Israeli kingdom, and commissioned the construction of the first temple. Upon his death, the Tanakh describes civil war and the splintering of the kingdom into two: Judea, centered on Jerusalem and the temple, and Israel, centered on Shechem. The Levant is one of the most historically diverse, continuously occupied regions in human history, populated by innumerable different ethnic groups over the past 10 millennia. The ancient Hebrews represent only one small chapter in that long history. The two kingdoms definitely existed according to the archaeological record, but there is no evidence that there was ever a united monarchy before them. They were two polities alternately skirmishing and allying in turn. Eventually, the north was conquered by Neo-Assyria. The south would later follow. It is this southern Judean kingdom that modern Zionists trace their mythical heritage, completely ignoring the fate of the northern \"ten lost tribes.\" Despite the dozens of populations around Africa and Asia who trace their lineage to the Samaritans.",

        "smushed_text": "This is such a fascinating case study in the mechanics of how US imperial interests get laundered through \"organic\" movements.\n\nFor context, the law being met with such backlash, inspiring existential dread over the threat of \"losing Georgia\" deals with... financial disclosures. https://t.co/5fmsJDdbEp Specifically, it would require NGOs and media organizations receiving at least 20% of their funding from a foreign source to disclose that information or face fines. It is opposed by pro-western groups, because it would reveal the extent of western influence in the country. President Salome Zourabishvili vetoed* the bill, but it was overturned in a 66-0 landslide, and the bill will go into force soon.\n\n*Georgia does not actually use a \"veto\" system. Instead, the president can either sign a law or return it to parliament with remarks. (Interestingly, the vote to reject the remarks was boycotted by a majority of the 150-member parliament.\n\nPer the Georgian constitution, parliament needs a simple majority to reject a president's remarks on a bill. Those who refused to vote could have upheld the veto.) The bill was championed by the coalition government of Georgian Dream and People's Power -- the latter of which split from the former over \"tactical\" disagreements, but they are still ideologically aligned. Their primary shared ideology is \"Georgian sovereignty.\" They are eclectic, shifting their positions to match a changing vision of what it means to \"make Georgia strong and independent.\" At various points, they have championed free trade with the EU and bids for accession, while frequently also decrying western influence in the region. They observe -- but do not impose -- sanctions against Russia over the invasion, while also refusing to provide any aid to Ukraine, whom they criticize. They view the west as attempting to do the same with them that they have done in Ukraine, in order to \"open a second front.\" Their foreign policy can best be described as \"Don't piss off the two major powers that we want to trade with.\" Unfortunately, that stance, in and of itself, pisses off the west. Anything other than full-throated anti-Russian dogmatism is a \"threat to western civilization.\" We saw this exact scenario play out a decade ago, in Ukraine, and now we're getting another chance to watch the dynamics of western meddling in action.\n\nIt starts with attempts by a smaller country to assert the right to forge its own foreign policy. In this case, that's a simple measure requiring transparency on foreign funding sources -- like the US. (In fact, the US already has a nearly identical regulation, the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which has been in force for nearly a century.) \"Mass protests\" spring up seemingly out of nowhere, largely made up of young, passionate, politically-amorphous \"activists,\" who are organized under the banner of a vague \"pro-democracy\" movement (democracy being defined as pro-west). The movement is fueled by fervor against a supposed \"authoritarian regime\" (in this case, Russia, but there have been plenty of similarly astroturfed movements against China, Cuba, etc.) The actual substance of the protests is largely irrelevant, and doesn't need to make sense. This is a particularly striking case, because the *only* vague connection that can be drawn between the law being protested and \"authoritarianism\" is the fact that Russia has a similar law (again, so does the US and many other countries). A law requiring financial disclosures of foreign capital investments has literally no bearing on the \"liberty\" of the vast majority of citizens -- especially students -- so its an unusually flimsy ground on which to stake a supposed \"battle for the soul of western civilization.\" But the aim of these \"movements\" is not specifically to prevent this or that policy. We can clearly see this from the fact that it was allowed to pass despite the vote to overturn the veto actually having more abstentions than votes. The goal isn't policy; it's *mobilization*. The visibility of the protests themselves aids in building a larger narrative of  \"popular discontent\" with the ruling government. Regardless of actual public opinion, large protests (organic or not) paint a picture of broad disapproval of whatever the government does. US geopolitical aims are laundered through media and NGOs -- such as the International Republican Institute, to which OP belongs -- presenting \"data\" and \"on-the-ground reporting\" that further builds this narrative of mass discontent. Sanctions and interventions tend to follow. Trade deals are ended, investments pulled, weapons find their way into the hands of the \"pro-democracy\" crowd. Then, hopefully -- for the US -- a coup, to oust this \"nefarious pro-Russian regime\" that wants to curtail western influence. Right now, it may seem silly that students are crying over a \"pro-Russian law\" that does nothing except require media operations to disclose foreign funding. But be aware that this is a key component of \"the Ukraine strategy.\" I expect a \"pro-democracy\" coup in the coming years.",

All they know is proletariat good, bourgeoisie bad, and so any deeper analysis than that feels like an ideological dead end. To the people who are utterly convinced of the necessity of revolution, my message is this: it's okay! It's okay to acknowledge your place in the imperial class structure, to understand that -- as it stands right now -- your classmates do not have revolutionary class interests. The same is true for the \"classic petty bourgeoisie.\" The same is true of the bourgeoisie of oppressed nations. You can be a class traitor. You can assess the class outcomes in front of you and *choose* class suicide over fighting to defend your historically untenable position. Revolution will progress either way. Liberation struggles across the empire, waged by those who don't have that choice, for whom the struggle is life or death. And as they do, the imperial way of life will collapse. Your deferred choice will be made for you one way or another.",

When your conception of \"Marxism\" ignores everything but vulgarized \"prole vs bourg\" it has no way to contend with national chauvinism. https://t.co/zuului93Kd Exhort \"the workers\" of the need for \"international proletarian revolution\" all you want; at the end of the day, the imperial bourgeoisie  can always offer them more through the spoils of empire, and without the tremendous risk involved in entertaining thoughts of revolution. The national project is not a \"distraction,\" it is an eagerly accepted bargain. It's the classic union busting strategy of selective incentives: targeting specific workers for promotion to remove them from the collective struggle and undermine the movement. The recipients of this bargain aren't being \"distracted\" by this maneuver: they are receiving real material benefits. In some cases, they may even be getting *more* than they would have from a successful unionization effort -- and with none of the risk and strife. Ignoring this means attempting to overcome the placating force of an entire section of the proletariat being promoted to cushy global management positions by appealing to an abstract indignation at being denied *even more* material benefits. You are trying to engender a sense of entitlement that the national project *already* taught them. Of course they want more. But what you promise as a communist is *less* than what the empire already promised them -- and the empire also promises and gives protection from chaos. Essentially, you are trying to tell them you can offer more than this -- that the empire is UNDER-delivering on an otherwise just promise. And you are imagining they will risk their lives to get it, fighting the very people who told them to want it.\n\nhttps://t.co/fXYXgftaOB You are selling an ideal to replace the real. That's why this strategy has failed for over a century. If you want these people on board, you have to start by building an alternative that they can see, right in front of them. Start with the people excluded from the bargain. Undermine the empire by organizing the colonial base. Make it too expensive to keep all the middle managers on the payroll. Poach the ones who recognize the need for collective struggle, and wage war on those whose only preoccupation is seizing back their imperial privileges.",

        "smushed_text": "Some important context to this headline:\n\nFirst, understand that \"world's richest 10%\"  refers largely to the population of the global north. The upper strata of places like China and India do contribute, but the cutoff for being in the top 10% is roughly $138,000 net worth. https://t.co/shHXqdNFYw In the US, the top 60% of the population has a net worth of at least that much. In China, only 6% of the population is in the global 90th percentile. In India, it's 3%. In the rest of the global south, that number begins to get vanishingly small. The second thing to note is that this isn't strictly about *individual* emissions, like Taylor Swift's jet belching out thousands of tons of CO2 per year. The methodology of the study (https://t.co/ADGXPreGVC) tracks production, trade, and final consumption. Crucially, they look at how wealth is invested into production. If an American company invests $100 million into building a factory in Nigeria, the emissions from that factory ought to be treated as stemming from $100 million of AMERICAN capital, not Nigerian. This is an important distinction, because the global south is used as the industrial engine of the global north. Third world labor creates first world value. Those who own the profit very clearly own the responsibility for the harm done in its pursuit. In many \"traditional\" surveys, this distinction is ignored. The emissions from that factory would be called Nigerian emissions. Hence many misleading statistics showing that the global north is \"decoupling GDP from emissions\" -- they aren't. They're just exporting the emissions. However, one important factor that this study does not seem to account for is the outsized role of the flow of embodied labor in the final *consumption* of the goods being produced. That is, who are the people for whom all this production is being done to serve? In some ways, the investment of capital *can* be a decent proxy for final consumption: that is, a European company might invest in a factory in Indonesia and sell the goods produced in the European market. Those emissions would be European. But what about an Indian company which builds a factory in India, and then sells the goods to an American wholesaler, who then distributes the goods to American retailers for consumption by the American market? How are those emissions apportioned? The most sensible assignment might divide up the value piecemeal. If 30% of the value ends up in Indian hands and 70% in American hands, we could say the emissions are a 30-70 split. But remember that this production *would not occur* without the existence of that final market. In other words, the final consumption *would* count as a piece of the driving force of those emissions. Taylor Swift's jet is not just responsible for emissions from burning fuel, but emissions from manufacturing the jet itself, emissions from producing the fuel, etc. On a more relatable scale, the emissions from your phone are not just coming from the electricity to power it, but from the manufacturing of the phone -- crafting, transporting and assembling each component, mining the raw materials, the emissions from the retailer, etc. It would be immensely difficult to get that granular, but even so, we can broadly say that, under the system of global imperialism, the entire chain of production is constantly churning out environmental destruction to transform third world labor into first world consumption. As long as this system remains in place, you cannot \"ethical consumption\" your way around the consequences.",

You achieve this by building revolution up from the bottom -- those most oppressed and most immune to the endogenous Hitlerism that is kept upright by standing on their throats. The *core* Hitlers are in the minority, and are outright outnumbered by these core anti-Hitlers, maintaining their supremacy only by sharing the spoils of exploitation with the defaultist Hitlers to bulk out their garrisons with foot soldiers and armaments. Your error in believing that this hegemony cannot be defeated is that you are trying to \"convert\" the foot soldiers, without having an opposing army for them to defect to, let alone making defection preferable. They don't even realize they've been conscripted in the first place. Build an army first, and begin fighting the real battle. The war itself reshapes the battlefield. The barracks are ravaged and the ruins abandoned by the CO Hitlers, shattering the material fetters holding these foot soldiers in political thrall to the regime. Some defaultists will, of course, become radicalized further in favor of the regime. Some will be radicalized against it. Most will simply be removed from the field of battle, anxiously watching to see how the war plays out, so they can side with the victor. As we continue to fight, the gravitational pull of the revolution grows exponentially, and the accretion of oppressed peoples reaches a critical mass that cannot be stopped by the faltering regime.

Today's revolutionary formations are laboratories, crucibles of experimentation. The results of those experiments guide how we proceed in the future. For this to work, we have to approach with the framing of falsifiability. We set out with the best ideas we have, based on careful study of the history of both revolution in general and our particular social context. We design our projects in such a way that will give us useful data, and we make ourselves quick to integrate that data into our practice. Not everything needs to be designed from scratch: we have plenty of history to draw on. But a refusal to approach this scientifically leads to orgs getting defanged, outmaneuvered, exhausted, and defeated, all in the name of preserving the \"prefiguration\" of a prophesied utopia.

In cows, the incidence of polymelia (being born with extra limbs) is about 16,000 times higher than polycephaly (multiple heads), which might lead one to conclude that counting heads is a more reliable metric... https://t.co/ryS4FrdrxT HOWEVER, both are rare, with the former happening in approximately 1 in 25,000 births, and the latter 1 in 400,000,000. We also need to factor in the incidence of cows which have FEWER limbs. I can't find statistics on phocomelia (congenitally missing limbs) incidence in cows. This leads me to assume that either it is vanishingly rare and/or has such low survival rate (naturally or because of human intervention) that we can consider it as irrelevant to herd statistics as cows with missing heads, i.e. there wouldn't be any at all, because... how? What is NOT statistically irrelevant is cows losing limbs *after* birth. Injury, disease, and especially poor living conditions all contribute to loss of limb, and this varies tremendously across time, geography, practices, and industry (beef vs dairy). I've seen estimates of 8%, 50%, &lt;1%, etc. All over the map, so not especially useful for getting hard data. However, what is absolutely clear is that acquired loss of limbs FAR outweighs the impact of congenital effects. In other words, counting limbs will always give you a statistically significant undercount of herd size. If the incidence is around 1 missing limbs per 100 cows at any given moment, this so-called \"fastest cow counter\" will consistently report 399 cows for every 400. Now, why did I go through all of this blather? What's the broader message?\n\nWell, mostly I'm just being silly, obviously.\n\nBut there actually is an important lesson here about the way statistical measures are so easily skewed by lack of consideration for outliers. All too often, we hear top-level statistics reported in a vacuum, and we just assume all appropriate respect was given to the analytical process -- the data collection methods, the consideration for confounding variables, the usefulness of the reporting format, etc. Population-level studies are notoriously difficult, both in terms of straight data collection (how do you even *find* the people you're looking for? how do you avoid sampling bias?) but also in terms of interpretation and drawing useful, meaningful conclusions. Even the process of compensating for variability and establishing error rate relies on *other* statistical information, which can *also* be biased. And the very questions you ask in the first place structure EVERYTHING about your study, possibly making it useless from the start. I'm not saying \"trust nothing and no one!\" But understand that there is nothing sacred about \"hard data.\"\n\n***If you understand what you're doing,*** you are totally free to pick apart sources and methodologies, even if the source is Official\u2122\ufe0f and Respected\u2122\ufe0f.",

We'll feed everyone by building a movement and winning revolution!\"\n\nOk, and where does this movement come from, if not the people who need to be fed? Try telling those people \"You'll eat when we win -- now join us!\" We aren't in \"competition\" with the \"revolutionaries\" who think this way. The people we're fighting for -- the people we *are* -- are beneath their regard. They think \"making sandwiches\" is a waste of time because they aren't concerned with the people who *need* those sandwiches. They think of precarious populations as an addendum to the cause of revolution. A tangential beneficiary, but not a significant contingent of the movement, let alone its primary driver. They often even view \"the lumpenproletariat\" as an antagonistic force, a cesspool of reaction. They base this chauvinistic view, not on their own investigation, but on rote recitations of canonical scripture. To the extent that they have any firsthand dealings with the precariat, it comes in the form of trying their same old tactics on them: throwing papers in their faces. When their preaching is roundly rejected -- when people who can't afford a sandwich fail to buy their precious little newspapers -- they internalize that as proof that these people are a \"lost cause.\" They can't conceive of why anyone WOULDN'T be swayed by diatribes and sermons. Sandwiches don't build revolution, because that targets hungry people, who aren't worth organizing. Hungry people aren't worth organizing, because they aren't swayed by literature, which is the best tactic. Literature is the best tactic because sandwiches don't build revolution. This is the circular logic of the trotskyists, whose lack of investigation and engagement with the most oppressed people is both caused by and contributes to their chauvinism. They can't break the cycle without breaking with dogma.\n\nThat's why their movements never materialize. At the end of the day, no, obviously revolution isn't built with sandwiches alone. It's built by the PEOPLE who need that support. People who will never listen to you, learn from you, trust you, and fight with you as long as you treat them as the afterthought you think they are.",

I was writing for an imagined audience of people who believe that there is literally a system of \"Don't Say Gay\" laws in China. @fugalise I also specifically didn't say anything about the very real dynamics of the *culture* in China, which are frequently quite antagonistic toward queerness. Queer media is often seen as \"unpublishable\" by mainstream media outfits. @fugalise I don't know much about the incidence of hate crimes, but I'm sure they happen, and I wouldn't be surprised if they are not taken as seriously by authorities.

        "smushed_text": "1776 was a direct reaction by Anglo colonists in North America to the imperialists back home telling them not to continue expanding west into French-claimed territory, following the terms of the treaty at the end of the Seven Years' War. The war was a global inter-imperialist conflict between Britain and France, largely triggered by British colonists breaking with the crown's uneasy truce with their imperial rival. This was the era of the Scramble for America, an attempt at an \"equitable\" theft of a continent. The conflict was preceded by decades of accelerating settler violence and building of a \"national identity\" for the colonists, promising the lower classes all the land they could steal and defend, from both the indigenous populations and the French colonial claimants. The French lost to the vastly more populous British colonists, and the Americans naturally used the fact of many natives fighting alongside the French as propaganda fuel for further genocidal incursions. The British continuously ordered them to stop violating the Treaty of Paris. When the colonists refused, the crown imposed increasing economic sanctions and measures of direct administration on them, which as we all know, the colonists used as yet more propaganda to help build nationalist fervor and foster an identity separate from Britain. We should be perfectly clear that the British empire was not at all interested in respecting indigenous sovereignty. They simply were not interested in perpetual war with France, and felt like their colonial interests in North America were perfectly satisfied for the time being. Britain wanted to focus its attention to the east (particularly in the much more lucrative Indian Ocean tea and spice trade). The treaty with France set the colonial borders at the Mississippi, giving them plenty of space for exporting cotton, tobacco, timber, fish, etc. The colonists on the other hand, wanted a larger piece of the pie from the colonial economy, and they wanted to expand all the way across the continent. As their independent economic and geopolitical interests diverged, they started organizing more and more militarily. Fighting between rebel colonists and the imperial troops started years before the Declaration of Independence. Skirmishes grew in size and severity, as Britain tried to tamp down the independent colonial ambitions of their own colonists. The War of Independence was not a \"revolution.\" It was not about poor, beleaguered colonists shaking off the oppressive yoke of empire: it was about BECOMING an empire, independent of the empire that had spawned them. And it signaled a qualitative leap in the ongoing genocide. In conclusion, fuck this cancerous Yankee growth that has metastasized all over the continent and the planet.",

Every step of the way, we need to be the people standing valiantly opposed to the violence of the regime under which we live. \ud83e\uddf5 https://t.co/La1haZtJm3 The belief that \"things have to get bad enough for people to care\" is rooted in the erasure of an extant class of people whose conditions already are \"that bad\" -- maybe because you don't see the extent of the ravages, or because you believe they have no revolutionary potential. I wouldn't accuse you of not *caring* about the ~20% of the population who are barely surviving. But empathy and charity only go so far. You're focusing your *organizing* on a \"target audience\" that is, in fact, surviving, even if it's tough and even getting tougher. That's not to erase the very real struggles of people who are not-quite-precarious. The people with some savings, but are watching them dwindle because they aren't keeping up with bills. The people who are getting treatment for chronic conditions, while racking up medical debt. The material strain on this \"fine-unless-fired\" subclass is very real, but it is characteristically different from \"not-fine-at-all.\" The difference being whether or not revolution is literally life or death for them. No one will risk their life for a better deal on rent. They might risk it to avoid dying on the street -- IF they can come to believe that that \"risk\" isn't just a suicide mission for a futile cause.\n\nThat's where communist organizing comes in. Accelerationism posits that that beleaguered 20% is not where the revolution lays, and that instead, we have to wait and hope and even actively push for conditions to deteriorate to that point for the next highest quintile, or even for the one above *that*. The reasoning for this view covers a range of errors:\n\n1) Dogmatic misapplication of Marxism to our immediate social context: \"We need the Industrial Proletariat\u2122\ufe0f to lead the revolution!\"\nIn the US, this describes less than 10% of the population, most of whom are VERY stable. 2) Misunderstanding of the mechanics of revolution: \"We can't win unless we have the majority on our side!\"\nYou don't need to -- and in fact CAN'T -- start a revolution with 51% support. You don't need 40%, or even 20%. You build support *by doing.* I can expand on this point in more detail later, but the broad strokes are: with a relatively small, but well-organized force, you can begin a feedback loop of growing support \u27a1\ufe0f greater material impact \u27a1\ufe0f meeting state repression \u27a1\ufe0f bystanders becoming revolutionaries \u27a1\ufe0f repeat. 3) Belief that, since revolutionary organizing takes time and resources, it can't start with people who have already have nothing.\nThere are two flaws in this argument. The first is that the \"nothing\" they have is in the context of capitalism. This population has labor power... ... it has resourcefulness and several practical skills, and if you aren't bogged down by blind allegiance to bourgeois law, there are resources to be found all over the place.\nThe other flaw is that, as conditions degrade, the population you bring on board will ALSO have little. 4) Chauvinism. Outright disdain for the types of people who occupy this class. The nationally oppressed, queer people, prostitutes, disabled people, and so on. It may be more or less overt, it might even disguise itself from those who hold it, but it MUST be rooted out. There are many more errors that lead people down this road, and it doesn't always specifically lead to accelerationism. It is much more common for it to manifest as reformism, economism, electoralism, and all too often \"doomerism.\" People drop out before the movement even begins. They shift their horizon from the complete abolition of the old world to \"Well, let's do whatever we can,\" or perhaps \"Guess there's nothing else to do but look after me and mine.\"\n\n(More realistically, their horizon never reached that farthest expanse in the first place.) If you DO want to make a difference, the answer is not to yearn for darker days. Begin the work now, organizing those whose days are already at their darkest. Build community support, organizational and ideological maturity, resources, plans, skills, agility... and hope. As people fall into precarity, your organization will already be there to catch them, because you invested your energy into building your capacity. And the more you catch, the more your capacity grows. People join movements that keep them alive.",

Making cancer treatment free??\" Because they know the obvious answer is yes.\n\nSo instead, it's a provider-by-provider patchwork. It falls to you to find out if you will be charged.

Why do we have an endless series of sub-par, means-tested programs instead of a universal floor to keep us all out of poverty?\n\nBecause this whole thing only works with the implicit threat of destitution.

        "smushed_text": "JANUS: What COVID variant JN.1 means for you.\n\nYou're probably aware that we are in a \"COVID wave\" right now. Testing is still tragically low right now, so it's hard to get a view of just how many cases are raging right now. (1/21) But wastewater data suggests we are at the second highest point in the pandemic, beaten only by the initial appearance of omicron.\n\nFor years, we've been hearing about \"waves\" of COVID. (2/21) This phrasing was engineered to naturalize the disease as being just like any other \"seasonal\" illness. This trend of passively reporting on poorly-defined \"cycles\" continued until the \"waves\" gave way to a single high tide. (3/21) It's hard to understate the rhetorical significance of this narrative. You've been trained on \"peaks we should worry about and valleys we shouldn't,\" until one day, they stopped reporting the peaks at all. Every week, high numbers came rolling in, with no fanfare. (4/21) Some have referred to this period as \"variant soup\" or other colorful nicknames. I maintained that it was a fleeting state of dynamic equilibrium between competing viral populations. Each population maintained its niche within a constantly fluctuating evolutionary context. (5/21) That context being the dynamics of each competing lineage. The primary driver of viral evolution is its ability to infect new people, which depends on a number of traits that SARS-CoV-2 is very good at: (6/21) physically reaching people, entering cells, evading immunity, and pumping out infectious particles that can reach more people.\n\nThat point about evading immunity is crucial for understanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. (7/21) For a virus that can spread so quickly and so far, the limiting factor is whether or not it can gain a foothold when it reaches a new host. This means that it has to constantly evolve to navigate a population full of people currently mounting a defense to *other* lineages. (8/21) Omicron represented an enormous shift in the evolutionary landscape, by happening upon a constellation of mutations that made it distinct enough from other variants to make any existing immunity obsolete without compromising on other factors, like cell entry. (9/21) It was so genetically distinct from the original SARS-CoV-2 virus that it became a qualitatively different disease. Omicron is as genetically distant from SARS2 as SARS2 was from SARS1, leading some to start colloquially referring to it as SARS-CoV-3. (10/21) It set the stage for a new era of the pandemic.\n\nAs omicron spread, it outcompeted every other lineage so thoroughly that it became the progenitor of every major subsequent variant. Official sources stopped giving variants Greek letter names. (11/21) Instead, they started tossing out strings of letters and numbers, or just referring to everything as an \"omicron subvariant.\" This was communications malpractice, as egregious as if they had never named any variants at all. (12/21) With the simultaneous rise of omicron and institutional pandemic denial, we saw the end of \"waves\" and the beginning of a constant background of elevated cases. Since late 2021, populations have been getting sicker and sicker... (13/21) ... with less and less awareness that we are even still in a pandemic at all.\n\nThis was the context when the next big shift occurred: the emergence of \"omicron subvariant BA.2.86,\" also known colloquially as \"Pirola.\" (14/21) Just as omicron was as distinct from SARS-CoV-2 as SARS-CoV-2 was from SARS, Pirola is AGAIN as distinct from omicron as omicron was from the original strain.\n\nFor the first few months of Pirola's existence, it concerned researchers on the basis of its immune evasion. (15/21) However, it hadn't yet made the same innovative leap that omicron had, of balancing that distinctiveness with transmissibility.\n\nEnter JN.1.\n\nJN.1 is the new omicron. This is not just a \"surge in cases,\" but a qualitative leap in the pandemic landscape. (16/21) It is so genetically distinct that, unless you've already been infected with it, your immune system is essentially completely naive to it. It is more transmissible than its parent, and it is driving the largest increase in cases and hospitalizations since omicron itself. (17/21) It is safe to say, there have only been 3 \"waves\" of COVID: its initial emergence, the rise of omicron\u2026 and right now.\n\nThe evolutionary landscape is being rewritten as we speak, and it's almost certain that all new major variants that emerge will be spawned from JN.1. (18/21) It is in this context that I believe it deserves its own name. I propose Janus.\n\nIn addition to bearing the same letters as the \"official\" name, Janus refers to the Roman god of transitions: endings and new beginnings. (19/21) As we enter January, the month named for him, we also enter a new era of the pandemic.\n\nWith any luck, this new era will bring much-needed changes to how we approach COVID. (20/21) If you were waiting for an excuse to return to practicing COVID safety, individually or organizationally, now is your chance. The institutions you look to for protection are not coming to save you: it's on us to protect each other. \n\nWelcome to the era of Janus. (21/21)",

But the constructs themselves are not false -- they are MADE real by the economic relations they were built to uphold, and which they uphold in turn. The hegemonic construct that prizes property as the economic fulcrum of its dominion must constantly reproduce itself. It does so primarily through the nation and through the family -- and all the attendant constructs that serve to naturalize and enforce the arrangement. So a \"coherent class reductionism\" is the misinterpretation of the various tributaries and embankments and channels of the river system of capitalism as \"distractions\" from the overall flow. They feed it, direct it, shape it, and reflect it. They are as real as real gets.",

Religion is a potent breeding ground for reactionary tendencies, and I certainly wouldn't suggest Marxist ignore that fact.

        "smushed_text": "Just in case you're unaware, exercise is not automatically good for you. One of the defining characteristics of several forms of disability is exercise intolerance, where physical exertion actually *decreases* your capacity. You cannot simply \"power through\" to recovery. (1/16) One of the earliest signs that something was wrong after I \"recovered\" from COVID was when I tried to get back to my routine of daily cardio. I wasn't trying to push myself too quickly, but I quickly found that even going on light walks was getting *harder*, not easier. There are a number of potential causes, ranging from neuromuscular to mitochondrial to immune issues. We know pretty conclusively that there's a huge difference between this form of disability and \"deconditioning,\" where your body has simply gotten used to not expending energy. Decades of bad science have supported this idea that, through careful planning and sheer willpower, you can build up your physical capacity. Large, well-funded studies supporting the rpg-style \"gain exp points and level up!\" theory have since been thoroughly debunked. There are so many potential etiologies for exercise intolerance, including genetic disorders (cystic fibrosis, Ehlers-Danlos, Huntington's), immune dysfunction following viral infection (long COVID, multiple sclerosis), and a wide array of cardiac diseases. So often, when \"the left\" talks about disability, it's done in an abstract, almost patronizing way. At worst, there's outright dismissal, but even the \"morally righteous allies\" adopt an attitude of \"being inclusive\" of what they imagine to be a tiny minority. The fringe cases. But collectively, the range of conditions that can cause exercise intolerance amounts to a HUGE proportion of population. One that is growing rapidly in the context of COVID.\n\nThe incidence of long COVID is growing, but severely underreported -- as high as 10% in official reports When the biggest impact of your disease is decreased capacity for exertion, it's incredibly difficult to rely on self-reporting. People justify it as \"I'm just tired lately\" or \"I haven't gotten back into a rhythm\" or \"I don't have the time these days\" or \"I'm getting older.\" Even with the difficulties of getting exact numbers, the multitude of potential causes leads us to, not a tiny minority that needs to be tiptoed around to avoid disrespecting, but a significant chunk of the population that cannot be expected to \"outrun the fascists.\" Obviously, we haven't even mentioned age, with young children and elders representing an enormous proportion of the population that, in general, cannot be expected to \"make themselves strong enough to fight or flee.\" As a general estimate, children, elders, and adults with various fitness-imparing disabilities could make up as much as 40% of the working class.\n\nThis is not some academic, liberal preoccupation with \"fairness.\" This is the reality of how revolutionaries must operate. Communists throughout history have had to contend with these numbers. They have built revolutions capable of overcoming a massive gulf between the physical might of the oppressors and their own disabled, malnourished, under-resourced, untrained, and dispersed populations. The fascists have the luxury of picking and choosing the \"cream of the crop.\" They eagerly discard those who don't serve their purposes. We don't have that.\n\nImagining that, if only we could make our people into fighting machines, we could win, is simply idle fantasy. That's not how communists win wars. We win because, when we do our jobs right, we have a MASSIVE pool of labor to draw on -- the entire working class. If even 1 in 30 of our people are willing and able to physically fight, and most of the rest support with their labor, we win. The Red Army peaked at 3% of the population of the Russian empire. The PLA was less than 1%. Starving, shivering, war-torn populations, who managed to produce a tiny minority of fighters -- and they still trounced the imperial armies. We will not out-exercise the fascists. You will not individually become strong enough to take on the cops, the Nazis, or the military. You will not outrun the bullets. We, as communists, have other strategies. Collective strategies. The ones that actually win wars. (16/16)",

Testing early and often, and treating everyone--no matter how \"severe\" they are--with an antiviral has always been the obvious brute force strategy. However, I worry that even this might be insufficient for true eradication. https://t.co/6Hfart6vtq They seem to only treat with antivirals until patients test negative. Just like we've seen with Paxlovid in the U.S., that is often insufficient for complete viral clearance. It reduces, but does not abrogate the chances of developing long COVID. I'm not a doctor, obviously, nor am I especially familiar with the risks of larger antiviral doses or the logistical issues of producing more doses. But I would love to see studies examining the impact of continuing antiviral treatment long past the negative test. Either way, it is absolutely a MASSIVE roadblock in the path of transmission, and undoubtedly can lead to an *effective* reproductive number &lt;1, meaning the virus could eventually be stamped out (assuming this strategy is kept up until it is truly gone). Short of total eradication, this also just means life is easier for individuals and society at large.

They couldn't completely convince people not to give a shit about themselves or others, but they managed to shift the \"calculation\" in favor of business-as-usual by repeating the total fabrication of \"COVID is mild now.\" https://t.co/7mQb0Vvfog https://t.co/gpJEG8Szv2 Other factors:\n\nEconomic enforcement of this attitude. In many cases, it's not that people are terminally selfish, it's that they're financially punished for being conscientious. Lack of legally-mandated paid sick leave means every potential sick day is a risk calculation. Even if you are fortunate enough to have sick leave, it's rare to have *unlimited* sick leave, and it's certainly never the case that taking a lot of time off has no impact on your career: being seen as \"lazy\" puts the bosses' eyes on you. So you need to calculate. If you have 8 sick days per year (national average in the US), you can easily use up all of it on staying home out of caution for \"mild illness\"... and then get really sick or injured and have no time left, putting your livelihood in jeopardy. And yes, people are being selfish when they decide to ignore a \"mild illness\" to avoid cancelling a trip they spent a lot of time and money planning. No one is *entitled* to a fancy getaway. But would they make that same calculation if they knew how dangerous COVID really was? We are dealing with a deliberately engineered mindset, fed into by mythmaking over the nature of disease itself, feeling entitled to historically-anomalous luxury, eugenics and feelings of ability being a static state, economic coercion, and so on, all to nudge that calculation. It's easy to call it \"selfish\" -- because it is! But it's important to understand how that selfishness is socially constructed, and how to deconstruct it. Information about disease severity can only penetrate so deeply. Even generous leave policies only go so far. But they help. Appealing to people's empathy is also only a half-measure; you are a single force, pushing back against a wall of radical individualism, bolstered by CENTURIES of capitalist culture-crafting. Rejection of the norm is a revolutionary transformation, and it doesn't come easily. That's why it's so critical to build a new norm. Communists work in organizations for a reason. We build *communities*, pulling them together when they have been carefully fragmented by a hegemonic rule that demands our alienation. Our job is not just to educate, but to model. Commit to making your organization a radically pro-health cornerstone. Do your good work, your education, your organizing, and do it under the banner of health. When your community thinks of you, make them think of people who care and help, and who demand others care and help. The same strategy applies to matters such as combatting chauvinism, collaborationism, passivity, nihilism, colonialism, etc. Be a bulwark against liberalism, be omnipresent in your community, be deliberate in your organization, be unabashed in your revolutionary aims and methods. I won't apologize for how this thread expanded so far beyond the original point. I'm sick of people feeling like we're all just permanently screwed, because \"people are too selfish.\" People are constructed by their society: be that society.",

We've known this for MONTHS. First, biochemically, with studies showing that the mutations found in omicron significantly reduce the ability of antibodies from both vaccinated and infected people to neutralize the virus. Now we ALSO have epidemiological data showing that even in vaccinated individuals and people who were previously infected, omicron can EASILY spread. As far as severity, that data is still coming in, but it should be pretty obvious by just looking at the sheer number of cases and hospitalizations in highly-vaccinated populations that VACCINES ALONE ARE NOT KEEPING POPULATIONS SAFE. This is not a message for the individual.\n\n*You* personally should definitely get vaccinated and boosted to be *more* safe than nothing at all.\n\nThis is a warning to the officials who refuse to do any lockdowns. And telling people that if they are vaccinated, restrictions don't apply to them might be a good way to score political points, but it is a public health CATASTROPHE.\n\nVaccinated people can get it, spread it, die from it.",

It never had a parasitic relationship with us. @Innomen Second, replication leading to mutations that potentially have phenotypic effects is exactly how evolution works. Sometimes those effects are negligible, sometimes they're harmful, sometimes they're beneficial. @Innomen The idea that viruses automatically mutate to become less lethal and more transmissible is not the whole truth. Influenza viruses are a good example of low lethality viruses occasionally mutating to become more virulent AND more deadly, leading to outbreaks like the Spanish flu. @Innomen Just because something can become more deadly does not mean it will wipe out humanity. That's not what I was claiming. My point is that we can easily be dealing with cycles of highly deadly and virulent strains forever, which is not something we should just accept.",

It shrouds itself in normality and evades the scalpel of analysis.

        "smushed_text": "I fully support people consciously not jumping to label themselves too specifically. The various terms for tendencies do have actual relevant meanings to them, and I wouldn't call them \"undead,\" but their relevance is *deeply* obfuscated in the western context. https://t.co/BZJhH72Uoq I maintain that, in the west, the vast majority of people calling themselves this or that tendency have simply picked up vague impressions of what it means to be \"Maoist\" or \"Trotskyist\" or \"anarchist,\" without reaching a level of development necessary to actually embody it. This isn't meant as an insult, it's simply a comment on the ideological desert we find ourselves in. There is no central infrastructure to become educated and trained in any political practice other than liberalism. Everyone is either self-taught or studying with a small group. That small-scale, dispersed model of study is the beginning stage of *building* a more coherent political framework, but until enough people study and coalesce into distinct ideologies, the highest rank one can generally achieve unaided is \"student of revolution.\" You can't even declare a major, let alone earn a degree in a given field, if there is no university at all. You *can* say \"I'm interested in science, and I like to read about scientific concepts.\" And you can even act as an amateur researcher in your spare time. But it would be jumping the gun to say \"I am a biochemist\" when you live in a society that doesn't even accept cell theory, let alone have avenues for studying, experimenting, and publishing in that field. If you've read about biochemistry from those who have actually done that work, and you know for certain that that's your jam, then it's appropriate to call yourself that. But if all you know is that you're convinced of cell theory in general, you are still a *student.* It's hard to trust someone who claims to believe in cell theory, or even *be* a biochemist, but hasn't actually studied enough to be able to explain or reproduce those experiments that built the theory in the first place. But again, that's fine, and it's a good starting point. The reason I'm confident calling myself a \"Marxist-Leninist\" is because I'm certain I've studied the theory enough to actually explain, adapt, and put it into practice. That doesn't mean I've attained a \"doctorate\" in the field. I'm just ready to put together a rudimentary lab. At the same time, I wouldn't expect anyone to automatically *believe* that I actually am a \"Marxist-Leninist,\" without us all agreeing on what that term means. I call myself that to maintain consistency across the various revolutionary contexts in which it's been used. In other words, I'm an ML because I understand and agree with the theories of parties throughout history who have also called themselves that. The ones who have accomplished what I wish to accomplish. As a scientist, I go with the theory that empirically demonstrates its fitness. Even agreeing on what constitutes \"success\" requires a pretty big theoretical leap, considering the hegemonic liberal baseline. If you believe all real Marxist-Leninist movements have been a disaster, you're probably not going to call yourself a Marxist-Leninist. This means you will also find yourself searching for an idealistic \"other way\" that \"hasn't been tried.\" (It has btw. It consistently fails.) Or you will continuously adapt your conception of \"success\" until it becomes so loose that you find yourself spoiled for choice of models. On the flip side, there are plenty of people calling themselves Marxist-Leninists because they do agree with that definition of success, but without understanding what ML actually means: what made those movements successful, how the theory must be applied here, etc. \"Marxist-Leninists,\" for example, who uphold national chauvinism, gender chauvinism, ableism, and myriad other counter-revolutionary tendencies. This, again, comes down to lack of actual study and practice (typically rooted in class instincts that dissuade further investigation). All that to say, I would much MUCH rather someone simply call themselves \"a communist\" while they're on the path to develop themselves politically. As you gain more confidence in what exactly you're developing towards, you can more confidently attach specificity to your label. Someday, there will be a legitimate Marxist-Leninist movement in the west, universally recognized for what it is and what it stands for. There will likely also be coherent, recognizable movements of other tendencies. At that point, specificity will be possible and necessary.",

Their statement has some use, but is also tinged with their own chauvinism.\n\nhttps://t.co/L39f04pdJW They do not make their argument from the place of protecting either indigenous peoples or the environment, whom both the Venezuelan and Guyanese governments have subordinated to the large-scale extraction of natural resources. For the PCV, it seems these concerns are irrelevant. They also clearly operate from a place of electoral opposition to the ruling PUSV, making the prediction that Maduro may plan to use the escalation as pretext to suspend next year's elections -- elections in which PCV intends to run candidates. They loudly proclaim their bona fides as Marxist-Leninists, anti-colonialists, and anti-imperialists, yet their stance does not reckon with the extractive, colonial nature of the bourgeois state they legitimate with their participation. They even supported Maduro until recently. They characterized the referendum as an attempt to instill chauvinistic patriotism, coupled as it was with a huge advertising effort to ensure popular support for it under the guise of \"sovereignty.\" And yet, they themselves \"affirm Venezuela's sovereignty\" in this statement. Nevertheless, they are overall correct in assessing that these moves are being made, not in the name of \"justice\" or to the benefit of the people, but at the behest of capital. They point to a recent deal made by Venezuela to open oil exports to the US.\n\nhttps://t.co/B0gipkyFfu It should come as little surprise that Venezuela would pursue detente with the US, using as leverage the massive fossil fuel reserves it commands. It is not socialist; it is very firmly capitalist. It has its own bourgeois class, who advance their interests through the state. The extent of its positioning as an enemy of the US empire is more akin to that of Russia than that of Cuba: its stubborn commitment to autarky and the advancement of its OWN bourgeoisie, rather than kneeling to western capital. It is still an economy predicated on exploitation, extraction, and displacement of indigenous peoples. Opening up to imperial fossil fuel interests doesn't change that fundamentally capitalist character; only the direction in which the profits of that exploitation flows.",

Russian oil and gas has long presented the biggest challenge to that hegemony. https://t.co/PEOwd3kivb Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the vultures immediately set in to rend flesh from bone. The now-infamous \"Russian oligarchs\" were made fabulously wealthy by providing US capitalists with access to the country's unfathomably large fossil fuel reserves. A mere decade later, Russia began renationalizing those reserves, and quickly exited its period of economic subjugation to western capital. Their explicit goal has always been economic sovereignty, while the US would have loved to turn it into another Middle East. Obviously this was never in the cards, due to Russia's nuclear weapons (and the US already focused on the *actual* Middle East imperial project). Instead, it had to resort to economically isolating it. Another decade after Russia began rebuilding itself, the plan came to a head. Having already expanded NATO and the EU to the majority of the former Warsaw Pact, the US set its sights on Ukraine, the gateway to Russia. Russian oil and natural gas exports, bound for Europe, flowed freely through Ukraine before the US-backed 2014 coup. Before 2014, the idea of Ukraine joining NATO was a fringe political position, with public opinion strongly opposed. Nevertheless, the new pro-west regime has been consistently courting NATO, and NATO has consistently strung them along -- to Russia's repeated consternation. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine did not come out of nowhere, nor was it the result of Russia being arbitrarily and uniquely \"violent.\" It was the culmination of decades of openly telegraphed moves by both Russia and the US, both attempting to lay claim to the European energy market. Russia is not \"good,\" and it's not \"bad.\" It's a capitalist state: a major power  with vast resources and a nuclear arsenal, attempting to avoid being yet another vassal of the US. Meanwhile, Ukraine already *has* become such a vassal. None of this has to do with \"care.\" The US \"cares about\" Ukraine for the exact same reason it \"doesn't care about\" Palestine. It's invested in both regions as part of its global empire. In both cases, the conflict revolves around US control of fossil fuels. In neither is support contingent on the people themselves.",

It is shockingly rare to see even a passing mention of COVID in any mass media, except in the vein of \"Oh haha remember that?\" It's NEVER present tense. By contrast, Dropout has remained vigilant and completely open about that fact. They are fully aware that COVID is still here, still serious, and still worth avoiding. We constantly see shots of the crew in respirators, and it feels like an intentional reminder to the audience. And when @GrantOB recently got COVID, they didn't try to hide that fact at all. They had substitutes that we wouldn't have even noticed were replacements, given the nature of the revolving cast, but still specifically pointed out \"We had to make changes because Grant got COVID.\" Obviously, this was revealed only with Grant's permission, which again speaks to the overall culture of transparency. COVID is not treated as \"don't ask, don't tell,\" like it so often is in everyday life, but especially when it comes to public-facing people and media. It's pretty uncharacteristic of me to heap praise on any company or public figure, especially for something that should be such a basic, obvious thing. I feel like I'm celebrating being tossed a few crumbs of recognition that COVID is still something to care about. And yet here we are. Thank you for the crumbs.\n\nSam, if you're reading this, I would love to interview you on Dropout's COVID culture, the details of your protocols, and how it came to be that you have stayed so on top of this.

They were artisans, craftspeople, traders, bankers, etc. They began accumulating wealth and power as feudalism waned. Over time, more and more serfs were enticed to move to the burgs to work for wages, rather than continue to toil for their lords. The emerging bourgeoisie became more organized into a political force, pushing for liberalism and the end to aristocratic privilege. Wherever they emerged victorious, the bourgeoisie cemented themselves as the ruling class, transitioning economies from feudal to capitalist rather rapidly. They solidified their social position, and today the struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariat is at its height.",

What \"organizations\" are you building? What relevance does your \"organizing\" have to anything? They're honestly just writing fanfiction about a young adult dystopia novel, where doorknocking to elect \"progressive Democrats\" gets you hunted down by blackshirts.\n\nI promise you, everything real is already either explicitly illegal, or subject to extrajudicial persecution. Even the most \"radical\" actions you can conceive of, like \"campus encampments\" or \"forest defenders\" get met with brutal, often bloody repression, by Democrats and Republicans alike -- and these actions *still* aren't even close to affecting change. There is simply no possible way to tactically maneuver the landscape of the bourgeois regime to make it more amenable to the kind of organizing that matters. No matter who is in power, no matter how carefully you toe the line of rules-as-written, the hammer will fall on you. You can meticulously craft an organization that operates wholly within the boundaries of the law every step of the way, and operates solely under the governance of the most progressive Democrats, and *still* find yourself getting torn apart if you're doing something that matters. If there is even a slight chance that your organization could feasibly liberate people, meeting your entire community's material and educational needs, developing them politically and forging the bedrock of revolution, you will face every counter-insurgency tactic in the book. Everything from lawfare to embargo to blacklisting to infiltration to media blitzes to trumped-up charges to \"accidental\" police brutality is in the cards, no matter who deals out the hand. You cannot affect the outcome as long as you stay in the game. The key is not to avoid doing anything that could bring that repression down on your heads. Surrendering before you've even fought is the same as being defeated. Instead, your \"organizing\" needs to take the form of training and planning to *win* in the face of that repression. Acting like any particular vote is a tactical maneuver to mitigate and delay the repression both ignores the active repression happening *right now*, and trains you to evade, rather than to win. Your instinct is to fold on every hand, hoping you'll eventually get lucky. You won't get lucky. You've never gotten lucky. The game is rigged. The only option is to stop playing, and organize something new.\n\nIf you can't see that now, when the choice is between Genocide Plus\u2122\ufe0f and Genocide Premium\u2122\ufe0f, I don't know how to convince you.",

This is the most successful Palestinian resistance operation in living memory, precisely because of the depth of organization and regimentation involved. This has been carefully built for *years*, ramping up in the past year to execute a centrally-planned offensive. Numerous factions, each with their own political bent, have been working in concert since 2020. Under the organization of the Joint Operations Room, they have trained together, strategized together, and stayed in constant communication throughout the operation. They have built supply chains, intelligence networks, and communications infrastructure, while carefully plotting a campaign to disrupt each of these crucial components of the occupying forces. The result has been borne out in their ability to seize and hold territory. This is like nothing Israel has seen since 1973, where it faced several states with standing militaries. Because the Palestinian resistance has made itself a fully formed military in its own right, Israel has no idea how to face them. They are 50 years out of practice.",

This isn't \"doing good imperfectly,\" it's complicity. It's counterproductive to the entire TB advocacy John Green does. There is a preponderance of evidence that COVID exacerbates the already massive health burden of TB: both by straining medical systems and through the virus itself impacting TB disease progression. COVID infection can reactivate latent TB. TB is a *strong* risk factor for severe COVID and vice versa. These are not disparate issues, and it is unfathomable to me that someone could be such a strong advocate on one front and a complete denier on the other. It would be like being a fierce advocate for the preservation of rainforests and wetlands, and yet totally unconcerned with the burning of fossil fuels. If such a person were to give a big wetland preservation speech, hosted by BP and Koch Industries, would that be \"imperfect\"? I'm not even saying John Green should be focusing his efforts on the MUCH bigger threat of COVID than on TB. Or even focusing *any* effort on some political project aimed at COVID. Literally just showing up to a TB conference in a respirator would be monumentally easy. It's really revealing that, for these two internet behemoths, the only way in which they are willing to stand up for a cause is when it is politically expedient. COVID advocacy -- or even simply *acknowledging* the ongoing disaster -- has been so thoroughly ostracized. The line about criticism \"turning people away from doing good\" is the most telling part. If you are turned away from good simply because people are not heaping uncritical praise upon you... you're not a champion of good. You're a narcissist.

I hear you. \ud83d\udc4d\" and plowed ahead regardless. https://t.co/5va2boQBmt They have made it absolutely clear with every new constitution, law, resolution, investment, propaganda message, and action, that their one and only goal is the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians through dispossession of land, demographic displacement, and economic embargo. Every scholar, institution, resistance group, and person with a working brain has said it for decades: the settlements are a deliberate effort to alter the demographic make-up of the region, and then wail about the \"human rights\" of the settlers to prevent rectification. \"Israel\" has never been restricted in its ambitions on this front, nor have they ever hidden those ambitions. The settler colony has never been legitimate in the first place, but it has also never respected the facile \"international law\" that has pretended to keep it in check. It has abided by no laws, no treaties, no toothless words of admonition from its imperial benefactor, and certainly no sense of decency. They do not want a two-state solution -- despite that ALREADY being a grotesque seizure of land. All they want is elimination of Palestinians.",

I think it's crucial for understanding fascism to recognize the two opposing strains and the separate geopolitical aims.

Vague calls for \"unity\" erase the central vector of national oppression -- the dispossession of political and economic rights along ethnic lines. The entire entity of \"Israel\" itself -- just like the US, Canada, South Africa, and other settler colonies -- is built on a bedrock of national oppression. The national identity of \"Israelis\" is an imperial construct, and there can be no reconciliation with that. The bottom line being that the participation of the \"Israeli\" working class is not necessary for Palestinian liberation, because that liberation necessarily involves ending the oppressive national filter through which \"Israeli\" can even exist as a coherent concept. Of course, the very same people currently calling themselves \"Israeli\" CAN be active participants in the liberation struggle. But they can't do so by trying to rehabilitate \"Israel\". They would need to divest themselves of their attachment to the \"Israeli\" identity.",

The reason we as a society haven't transitioned to clean energy sources in the 100+ years since their invention is because capital-holders never invested in the technology. (1/6) They actively avoided it, in fact. The main reason for this wasn't scepticism that it could ever be made efficient or catch on: it was a fear that it would cut into profits, since it's free. Solar power, for example, made a huge splash waaaay back in the NINETEENTH CENTURY. (2/6) It was presented as an alternative to coal, which people were afraid would run out. But as more coal deposits and better extraction/transport techniques were discovered, capitalists decided to keep investing in that, since it relied on a resource that they could control. (3/6) In the 1980s, Exxon researchers discovered climate change for the first time, and made recommendations to the company that it should transition its operations to carbonless energy. Instead, the company built its offshore rigs higher up, to prepare for rising ocean levels. (4/6) In short, climate change has happened not because of negligence, but because clean, renewable energy can be accessed without huge investments of capital. This means those who already have the money to invest in dirty energy would lose their biggest superpower: restriction. (5/6) With clean energy, you don't need to find and purchase land rich in a particular resource, you don't need expensive infrastructure to harvest and transport it, so access to it can't be restricted. That is the *only* reason the energy grid wasn't build to be clean from the start.",

I have plenty of thoughts on that as well, but that'll have to wait. 2) The liberal strain tends to be consistently outnumbered and outvoted by those with a more ambitious horizon in mind for the organization (even if they first have to wade through overwrought debate over minutiae). 3) Even among the left of the caucus, there's a current of tacitly accepting liberal mythmaking with regard to the nature of revolution, AES, and democracy. For example, preoccupation with the concept of \"bureaucratic bloat,\" guiding opposition to implementing explicit protocols. 4) The caucus seems to be one of the most politically developed Marxist organizations in the US, which is more a repudiation of the movement as a whole than a praise of the caucus. There is certainly a huge gulf between where MUG is and where a revolutionary org would need to be. 5) There seems to be a HUGE appetite for political development among MUG members and a clear recognition of how far they still need to go. Liberalism seems to be a fading force within the caucus, driven by a steady commitment to study. All in all, this does seem like a useful locus for building an actual revolutionary force in the US, if for no other reason that there is already a considerable number of Marxists there, engaged in purposeful study. It remains to be seen how productively that study will progress. One thing that is clear is that a crucial moment will come -- hopefully soon -- where MUG will need to develop itself into a faction capable of operating independently of the intractable, anticommunist grasp of DSA. It will need to Bolshevize.",

Dept. regulation stating that schools could not have blanket bans on trans athletes, but clarified that they would be permitted to define eligibility in a way that excludes them as a matter of course. As assaults on trans existence continue to escalate -- both in the realm of public policy and private discrimination -- Biden has done absolutely nothing to fight back against this. He has failed to champion specific legislation that he promised, such as the Equality Act... ... leaving queer people subject to housing, employment, and educational discrimination. He has failed to ban conversion therapy, has done nothing to ensure the safety of queer youth kicked out of their homes, and crucially, has done nothing to ensure queer health. His biggest offense, however, is as a stalwart imperialist. He has, as with every president in a generation, expanded the fascist border policies that destroy the families and lives of immigrants, disproportionately harming queer immigrants in the process. His unflinching support for the genocide of Palestinians has contributed to the death, dismemberment, and displacement of thousands of queer Gazans in the past month alone, all of whom have spent their entire lives deprived of healthcare and freedom of movement. Do only the lives of Western queer people matter to you? Are these not our cousins?

The previous feudal order had approached this problem in a number of other ways, particularly institutionalized (vs. folk) religion, aristocratic privilege, and a whole lot of monarchism and inter-kingdom warfare. For the liberals, the solution was the construction of the nation. And the cultural lines they drew upon for building their nations? Primarily language. They identified the \"natural\" boundaries of the nation-state according to mutually-intelligible dialects, then got to work ensuring that those dialects were unified through a \"common tongue.\" Zionism is such an interesting case, because in order for it to have a chance as an ethnonationalist colonial construct, they needed massive buy-in. That meant building a de novo conception of a shared cultural identity among worldwide Jewry -- one centered on the Zionist entity. This was a tough prospect, because Jewish populations were so dispersed, enmeshed within diverse cultural spheres, each with their own languages, cultural practices, and religious traditions. The Zionists decided to \"revive\" the shared liturgical language of Hebrew to ease this. \"Modern Hebrew\" was a solution to the question of \"How do you construct a nation where traditional bourgeois conceptions of it don't apply?\" Namely, the fact that they could not draw upon an existing population to build a \"nation-in-place.\" It had to be imported. The Zionists couldn't simply appropriate and expand on the existing Jewish culture within Palestine -- the Old Yishuv -- for a number of reasons. Through centuries of natural admixture with the surrounding Arabic population, Palestinian Jews spoke languages infused with Arabic. The \"traditional\" bourgeois nation-building project in Palestine would have created an Arabic-speaking Palestinian nation, emphasizing whatever cultural facets they could to distinguish themselves from surrounding Arabic-speaking nations as they emerged. This would necessarily have resulted in a nation that was categorically not Jewish (although certainly could have included a sizable cultural influence from Palestinian Jews), and certainly NOT European -- which was obviously not aligned with the purposes of European Zionists. To build their colony, they needed a novel kind of nation-building, one built on crafting a new people, with a new language, and especially a new allegiance to the new colonial ruling class. Thus, modern Hebrew was born.",

You can regenerate the substance by heating it to 60\u00b0C, allowing for its reuse! You just need to heat those 440 trillion kilograms annually to match our emissions. Of course, that also takes energy... The article doesn't give a specific heat capacity, but going by other COFs, it could be as low as 0.4 J/g*K.\n\nRaising COF-999 up to 60\u00b0C might take only 16 J/g, which would mean 7.09 million terajoules per year to regenerate our 440 trillion kilograms of this miracle chemical! Of course, the process of regenerating COF-999 would then require us to find somewhere ELSE to put those 40 billion tonnes of CO2. Generally, carbon capture relies on pipelines pumping the captured carbon deep underground, which carries its own massive energy cost. We also haven't accounted for the energy of production of the substance, transportation, manufacturing the massive amounts of infrastructure, the fans needed to move air over it to allow it to capture CO2, and so many other considerations. Carbon capture will not save us. It's a measure of cope taken to utterly absurd degrees. You're taking the proposition of bailing water out of a sinking ship full of holes, and saying \"But look, we just designed a better bucket! Now it's ok that the holes keep getting bigger!\" For all its supposed complexity, there is exactly one solution to climate change.\n\nStop. Burning. Fossil. Fuels.\n\nThe only innovation that can end this is a social innovation: the end of endless growth. The end of capitalism.",

But the truth is that that's exactly what we have to do. Anything short of that will simply be overridden by the same power structures that got us here to begin with. @_RollerGirl_ Some of the work USU is doing is aimed at guides for how to study revolution, how to form organizations, how to congeal them into a revolution-focused party, etc. In other words, translating centuries of history into a theoretical foundation for our contemporary conditions. @_RollerGirl_ It feels like an unsatisfying answer.

It's simply a vibe someone decided to illustrate. https://t.co/8q1dJFzXIH Here's an actual graph from the study that spawned this common misconception that ignorant people think they are more competent than informed people.\n\nThe researchers gave participants a series of questions to answer, then sorted them into quartiles based on their performance. https://t.co/kFYOTOlBoD They then asked participants to estimate how well they did in terms of actual scores and compared to other participants. Notice that, although the bottom quartile does overestimate their performance, they don't overestimate to the point of believing they outperformed the top. In fact, the bottom quartile only believed that they did a bit better than the average. The better-than-average effect is a well-documented phenomenon, wherein a majority of people don't necessarily think they're *great* at a given task, but they do think they're above average. Typically, this is a consequence of a cognitive bias to underemphasize the impact of unknown factors and overemphasize what's in front of you. In other words, an individual's own performance is always front of mind, and easier to conceptualize than a nebulous \"average ability.\" Getting back to Dunning-Kruger, the study itself has since been disputed, due to some glaring design flaws. The effect being demonstrated and presented as a \"profound psychological truism\" has been recapitulated using randomly generated data, a result of statistical artifacts. The actual empirical result of this and various follow-up studies is pretty simple: people tend to think they perform slightly better than a vague \"average person\" -- unless they know what the average is. The further away from the average, the greater the statistical disparity. Other studies have examined how people rate their performance on various tests in more objective contexts, using less statistically noisy analysis, and found that, although people tend to slightly overestimate their performance, they do assess their skill pretty well. For example, you might give participants a 20-question test, then ask them how they did. Someone who got 7 questions right might say \"Hm... That was pretty hard. I think I got 8 or 9 questions right.\" You might then ask them how they think others did, and they might say, \"Well, like I said, it was pretty hard. I'm guessing the average result was maybe 6 or 7, and the top score was probably 12.\"\n\nThey think they did better than average, but they don't think they did THE BEST. Of course, none of this *actual science* really matters to the liberals who smugly post the same picture of a misinterpreted conclusion from an iffy study. They would never let something as silly as material reality get in the way of a satisfying narrative.",

It is a nationality, specifically in the context of the empire creating that nationality to act as the locus of colonial oppression. @stonebutchguts @FoxyMarxist It's not an \"organic\" nation, but neither is any nation -- nations are created by social relations. It's not a nation we should respect as having any \"right\" to \"self-determination,\" it's simply an important aspect of the colonial project itself (and therefore in its undoing).",

Yes, oppressed classes should be armed. And yes, those armed classes should be regimented into a state apparatus capable of retaining their class dominance over their old oppressors, until those oppressor classes have been eradicated. The proletarian state -- specifically, its need for organized repression of counter-revolutionary organizing -- is \"temporary\" on the scale of history. Unlike bourgeois states, the goal is not endless expansion, but rather accomplishing a specific, achievable goal. But we obviously can't put a timeline on that, or even expect it to be achieved within our lifetime. In the same way that you can't put a timeline on eliminating cancer from the body; it requires an ongoing campaign of seeking out and destroying every malignant cell.",

        "smushed_text": "I wanna take a quick break from thinking about the rising tide of fascism, the permanent pandemic, and the climate apocalypse to get into some good old fashioned science weirdness.\n\nI want to tell you the story of the single-celled woman. Our story begins with the beginning of life itself.\n\nLiving things are made of tiny cells, which contain both the genetic instructions and the physical machinery for making more cells.\n\nThe first life forms were just single cells that could replicate themselves. These single-celled organisms evolved over time because of two simple facts:\n\n1) Every time they copied their genetic material, tiny mistakes were made that could change the new cell\n\n2) Changes that made the new cell able to make *more* new cells became more common Over time, tiny changes added up. Cells gained the ability to harvest sunlight, eat other cells, grow bigger... and eventually, stick together in cooperative colonies.\n\nCell colonies could share resources and ensure that more of them survived, making their genes more successful. These colonies gave rise to a new advancement in evolution: specialization. Depending on where in the colony a cell was located, it would turn some genes on and switch some genes off. Cells on the outside could focus on defense, while the inside could focus on growth. This was the beginning of multicellular life: things like trees, dogs, and you!\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective \"you\" are your sex cells, whose goal is to reproduce... Plus a bunch of other stuff like stomachs and brains to help those cells accomplish that goal. It's really a great strategy to have all that extra stuff. But it comes with a need for very strict rules: every cell in your body MUST behave. 32 trillion human cells, all of which *could* reproduce, but give that up to help the sex cells. No going rogue! Except sometimes they do go rogue.\n\nCancer is what happens when your body cells start doing single-celled stuff again. They've been reproducing this whole time to replenish old cells, evolving all along. If they mutate to the point where they can ignore those rules... Cancer. A cancer cell is essentially its own single-celled organism living inside your body. It wants to do what organisms do: collect energy, replicate itself, and spread its genes. The problem is that it does this by stealing *your* energy and pushing everything out of the way. This is what happened to Henrietta Lacks, a black woman with cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital. While seeking treatment, her cancer was biopsied and studied by George Otto Gey. He noticed some odd properties to these cells, and continued to grow them and study them. This was done without the knowledge, consent, or compensation of Henrietta or her family. It wasn't until decades after her death that her family discovered this malfeasance.\n\nIn that time her cancer cells had continued to be replicated in labs, used for their unique properties. These cells behaved less like human body cells, which eventually stop replicating as the DNA wears down, and more like single-celled organisms, which can replicate endlessly.\n\nThis lineage, called HeLa, are human cells that grow and evolve exactly like you'd expect from bacteria. Their DNA is a human genome. They have mutations that make them different, but so do the cells of different humans! These cells are unambiguously human. If you gave an alien some HeLa cells and a sample of your cells, it would look at them and say \"these are the same species.\" Henrietta Lacks died on October 4th, 1951, succumbing to the cancer. That parasitic organism that shared most of her genes had spread throughout her entire body.\n\nShe was only 31 years old. Through the actions of an unscrupulous researcher, the thing that killed her lives on to this day.\n\nIt is used by researchers all over the world: a single-celled organism that evolved from a human, and is still human enough to allow us to study human cells. There are probably around 50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 of Henrietta's cells out there right now: they are the single-celled lineage of a multicellular human.\n\nShe is now recognized and honored by the scientific community, decades too late.\n\nMay her memory be a blessing.",

        "smushed_text": "There is no such thing as \"left antisemitism.\" Any actual antisemitic mythemes you spot among \"the left\" are the result of syncretism: fascists draping themselves in red garb, undermining a materialist framework in favor of aesthetics. They have no power to advance their hogwash. It is true that the key thinkers of the ascendant wing of fascism -- the \"revanchists,\" overtaking the \"supranationalists\" -- uphold this theoretical framing. They posit a \"once-pure, righteous hierarchy\" that has been tampered with by scheming alien elements. In this framework, they are able to slot whichever \"alien element\" is most rhetorically useful at any given moment, and they are constantly probing their base to find the best targets (defining \"best\" as \"when we agitate around this, our people respond\"). At the moment, Jews are very low on the list of buttons to press, both because there is a lower extant appetite to draw on compared to other buttons, and because of the tactical limitations posed by Israel's continued usefulness. Drawing on antisemitism while still propping up Israel is a messy proposition, although not impossible.\n\nIn fact, expect to see exactly that as US support for Israel winds down. The response to antisemitic probing will help the revanchists modulate the speed of their withdrawal. But for now, they have plenty of other, much more useful buttons to press: Muslims, China, immigrants, \"criminals,\" trans people, etc.\n\nEach individual target draws on particular \"anxieties\" -- that is, vulnerabilities in the edifice of white nationalist hegemony. I could go point by point on each, but most relevant to the topic at hand is the use of \"Jew\" as a dogwhistle for \"financial capital.\"\n\nThere is an inkling among the Faithful of the Nation that capitalism is being puppeteered and diverted from its \"natural form\" by \"bankers.\" This conception allows them to pin any perceived fall in standing on the manipulation of capital by those who don't deserve it -- an alien entity who parasitizes production without producing (with the understanding, of course, that \"normal\" capitalists are doing the production). This framing allows labor aristocrats and the petty bourgeoisie to cling to capitalism itself without recognizing financialization as a *composite* of lower forms of accumulation. The highest capitalists aren't pooling their winnings to multiply profit -- they're being puppeted! And of course, that framing requires something from *outside* the Great White Nation to be doing the manipulation. Someone clever, scurrilous, and greedy enough to subvert the natural order, but weak and cowardly enough to be incapable of ascending its ranks \"naturally.\" Jews have filled this narrative niche nicely for centuries. When communists started gaining power, it was trivial to equate the two, painting communism as the latest Jewish plot to topple the white, capitalist, natural way of life. Israel tempered the thematic coherence of that narrative -- Jews were now *useful* to the empire. And they were doing colonialism! Fighting \"the savages\"! Not so weak and cowardly anymore. They weren't parasitizing white production, they were \"justly ruling\" the Middle East. The point of all this is to establish the fact that fascism relies heavily on aesthetics and mythology to animate its constituents. The particulars are not random; they are continuously probed for and reworked to fit the moment.\n\nAnd at the moment, Jews are not a valuable probe.",

And yes, that includes the actions taken by you and me. We didn't \"choose\" to be here or to take part in this project that extracts and exploits and oppresses. We were handed a lifestyle and told we deserved it as a matter of course. And that indoctrination is part of \"America.\" You can be exploited and still exploit, without any evil intent behind it. Your \"goodness\" or \"badness\" are irrelevant. You make choices to advance your own survival and comfort -- nothing inherently wrong with that! A liberated world will certainly bring survival and comfort. But the \"Americanness\" of it all makes it so it is necessarily IMPOSSIBLE to improve your material position without those gains coming directly out of the exploitation of others. \"There is no ethical consumption under capitalism\" is not moral absolution -- it is condemnation.

        "smushed_text": "There seems to be a persistent myth (esp. among better-informed folks) that COVID will inevitably evolve to become lower impact. The idea is that the virus \"wants\" to trade lethality for infectiousness, since dead hosts can't spread it.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the case. We've known for a long time that you can spread COVID while asymptomatic. In fact, your *highest* level of infectiousness is just before symptoms show up (if they ever do). You can also spread COVID even if you *never* develop symptoms! In viruses, just like everything else with genetic material, mutations naturally occur every time that genetic material is replicated, which can affect their traits. Most do nothing, some kill the virus, some make it more or less infectious, some make it more or less lethal. Evolution works through selective pressure: if the environment of the population that is evolving makes it harder for some individuals to replicate and easier for others, based on those different traits, you'll inevitably see more individuals with the \"better\" traits. In the case of this virus, that environment is both the host it is currently infecting *and* all the people around it that it wants to infect. So traits that make a virus more able to spread inside a host are selected for, as well as traits that help it spread from host to host. In some viruses, there is actually a trade-off, because hosts fighting off a rapidly spreading infection tend to feel weak, avoid other people, etc. But COVID has a secret weapon: it can spread pretty far *without* triggering symptoms. The reasons for this are really complicated, and we don't have a complete picture. But put simply, the virus can infect the cells your body uses to kickstart the immune response (read: symptoms), slowing them down a lot. This lets the virus spread before you know it's there. That means there is no selective pressure against the virus spreading rapidly within a host, since it can do so without triggering symptoms that might hamper its ability to find new hosts. It's theorized that this initial spread impacts the eventual severity of the disease. Omicron is an example of a bunch of mutations that make it able to spread from host to host (even if the hosts have some prior immunity) and mutations that seem to make it less lethal. However, this is happenstance: a viral lineage that happened to evolve both sets of mutations. There's no reason to believe that future variants have to balance infectiousness against lethality. In fact, it is absolutely possible that *both* can be selected for, assuming that that initial pre-symptomatic stage does turn out to impact disease outcome.",

        "smushed_text": "It's not that wild. Production that society collapses without is, by definition, production that has been subjected to the greatest pressure for efficiency for the longest time. Every social force is arrayed around keeping that labor flowing. There are many ways this plays out: https://t.co/t6dSKwnzo2 First of all, class society emerges around specifically regimenting the most necessary production, such as food. Those who can compel that production and control the distribution of the product are the ones who shape society as it develops, further solidifying that relation. As society develops, productive forces progress, with existing production being constantly made more labor-efficient, thereby freeing up labor for allocation to emergent production. You cannot produce microchips if everyone is busy producing food. The ruling classes are constantly shifting their production toward higher rates of surplus extraction. (This isn't exactly an *individual* patrician, lord, or capitalist shifting their *own* production, but rather the shape of the class as a whole changing, piece by piece.) One factor in the freeing up of labor for higher production is through technological advancement; less labor becomes necessary for the same amount of that basal production as the tools and techniques for that production become more efficient and widespread. Another factor in this process is the depression of the power held by those doing that basal production. Maintaining an underclass of precarious workers in those industries allows you to extract more value for less. Slaves, migrants, people making poverty wages, etc. These processes feed into each other. Increased technologization makes it easier to slot *anyone* into the remaining labor input without needing to invest in high levels of training. Higher efficiency frees up labor to produce that technology. The goal (or rather, the inexorable flow of capital, regardless of individual intent) becomes to relegate as much production as possible to the realm of \"unskilled labor,\" to smooth the way for the steady march toward higher rates of profit. And that starts from the base up. Agriculture goes from requiring 90% of the population to 50%, then 25%, then 10%, with the rest of the working classes moving up the labor hierarchy. That general pattern repeats itself in the next layer of the pyramid, then the next, resulting in ever-more complex production. If you think that would lead to an obscenely top-heavy economy, with the majority of workers working in ever-more \"unnecessary\" work, and the stuff that keeps society functioning highly vulnerable to disruption, you'd be correct. And that's where imperialism comes in. Among those \"higher level\" industries are the tools of empire. Global shipping and logistics, military infrastructure, geopolitical maneuvering. The more an empire is able to expand its dominion, the greater the base of the pyramid grows. Those most basal industries that have been most deskilled are the easiest to export to the global south -- so long as the workers *there* can be maintained as a permanent underclass. Food production, extraction of raw materials, clothes manufacturing, etc. Just like production of agricultural machinery is both made possible by and feeds into the efficiency of food production, the production of the machinery of empire does the same around the world, by ensuring there are always plenty of fish in the global sea of labor. Unskilled labor is not a myth: it's intentional, and integral to the capitalist mode of production. It's how the ruling class expands its power. It's how the labor aristocracy is created and maintained.",

This is exactly why the settler-indigenous relation is primary, and cannot be ignored in favor of \"real class relations.\" The entire point of constructing the settler identity is to *materially* benefit  that entire class, above and beyond those who are displaced, enslaved, murdered, segregated, denied infrastructure, etc. The \"fake\" delineation is as real as the delineation between rich and poor. Money is also a \"social construct,\" and you would be rightly laughed out of the room for claiming that the division between rich and poor is a distraction from \"real differences.\"\n\n...

Kornilov, along with the military officers who supported him, were motivated by a desire to crush both the Petrograd Soviet and the Bolsheviks. The Soviet was much more powerful and influential within the city than the provisional government. They organized the armed defense of the city against the forces of Kornilov. It was Kerensky who allied with *them* out of self-preservation, not the other way around. Several Bolshevik leaders, who had been arrested since the July Days, were released to help with the defense of the city. The Soviet and the Bolsheviks were armed and ready, to meet the imminent violence. Bolsheviks conducted sabotage efforts to deter Kornilov's advance. At no point in this chapter of revolutionary did Lenin or any other Bolshevik say \"Alright gents, time for us to swallow our pride and vote for the lesser of two evils!\"\n\nInstead, Kerensky crawled on his knees, begging them to defend him against the threat he had helped create. So unless your proposed \"temporary alliance\" involves us, as communists, already holding equal or greater power to that of the government, and the Democrats freeing and arming us to meet impending fascist violence with our own violent resistance, the comparison has no relevance.",

It's an attempt to launder grotesquely unequal social structures as being \"natural constraints,\" around which the beneficiaries of those systems must \"impartially calculate\" the most deserving of pet causes. https://t.co/3wPp3Qe19O The supposed principle of \"do the most good with the resources available\" is pretty easily disproven by its proponents continuing to have any wealth at all. They apply that logic to choosing charities, but not to the systems that give them those resources in the first place. The classic \"effective altruism\" thought experiment: is it better to save a drowning child, knowing it will ruin your suit, or to let the child drown, sell the suit, and donate the proceeds to a charity that will use that money to save multiple children. Whatever choice a particular \"effective altruist\" finds more favorable, the pretext is never questioned. The question can only even be considered by someone who could conceive of owning a suit that's so expensive that its sale could save multiple lives. The dying children and the suit are considered from the beginning as being unrelated factors that the \"altruist\" has the option to *make* related, by \"graciously\" giving up the suit in favor of either destroying it to save one child or donating its value to save many. But the unexamined backdrop of this scenario is, of course, a society that directs labor and concentrates the value produced into fancy suits, while children are left to die -- unless the \"right people\" deign to willingly part with some small portion of their excess. The true ethical dilemma, then, is not whether to prioritize the life of the one child in front of the suit-wearer or many anonymous lives. It is whether or not the existence of a society in which someone could hold the lives of many in thrall to his whims is tolerable at all. That the suited man deserves the suit, and to be in a position to make this choice at all, is never questioned. It is the natural consequence of forces beyond his control. He has been thrust into a world where he is dripping in diamonds, and must struggle to use them responsibly. This is why \"effective altruists\" take such issue with the phrase \"the purpose of a system is what it does.\" If that was the case, then those many lives that could be saved by simply selling their suits would only be in danger *because* of the system that gave them the suit. Their noble choice to donate a portion of their wealth to \"the most effective charities\" would transform from an act of altruism into a tiny, pathetic minimum interest payment on an astronomical ethical debt. One which could never be repaid without expunging ALL of their wealth. The only \"effective altruism\" would be dedicating one's life to the total abolition of poverty -- i.e. the destruction of the economic system that creates poverty in exchange for concentrating wealth and power into the hands of the few -- among them, every \"effective altruist.\"",

        "smushed_text": "I am certainly not a \"China is imperialist too!\" type, or a \"China isn't socialist\" type, but they are absolutely failing to do enough to oppose the US empire, and *especially* failing on the most visible anti-imperialist struggle going on right. I have predicably angered both Team China-is-Evil and Team-China-Can-Do-No-Wrong. If you're looking for a debate, you guys can go digging through the quotes and comments to find each other. Their approach to countering US hegemony continues the same way it has for decades: growing their productive power, using that power to act as the central pillar propping up a global economic system that is increasingly divested from the imperial one, and then... what? The entire point of that plan -- which has certainly been yielding results -- is to create the conditions for the oppressed peoples of the world to liberate themselves. Well guess what? Those oppressed peoples ARE liberating themselves. The conditions are here, right now. China itself already has a larger economy than the US proper, and simply crushes it in productive capacity. The US-centered *imperial apparatus* is still more powerful than the parts of the world economy outside its grasp, but that's not really relevant to the goal of liberation. If individual liberation struggles could rely on free-flowing Chinese support, every single one would be likely to succeed. It takes a LOT less productive power to liberate than it does to oppress: every revolution in history has demonstrated that. With every successful struggle, the power of the empire gets chipped away, and a new economy enters the growing opposition bloc. This is happening regardless of \"free-flowing Chinese support,\" but it is being paid for with the blood of countless victims of imperial repression. The issue, obviously, is that China *can't* simply provide free-flowing support because of the particular way it has been able to build that vast economic power. Call it \"a deal with the devil,\" call it \"tricking the capitalists,\" the result is the same: Capital controls a huge portion of the Chinese economy, as well as the broader economies of those nations that have begun divesting themselves from *western* capital. China has to constantly work around this powerful countervailing force, which seeks to maintain world capitalism. In recent years, China has been moving to weaken the influence of their own capitalists, but it is a slow process, and has not kept pace with the acceleration of both global liberation struggles and the imperial repression against them. Short of an unprecedented campaign to immediately expropriate all capitalist-held wealth in China, all at once -- which would immediately trigger destructive backlash by the US-led world order -- China feels it cannot simply operate independently of those capitalists. Even with all that in mind, there is a lot more it could be doing to support the axis of resistance. I don't think it's ludicrous to suggest that it could get away with being much bolder and riskier. It's justifiable to say their approach goes beyond \"caution\" and into cowardice. They're scared of upsetting the balance they have been working to build to countervail US hegemony, putting them into a weaker position on the world stage. They're scared of capital flight, military reprisal, and counter-revolution within China. That fear is justified. But there's a difference between being aware of the risks of a given action and allowing those risks to keep you from action altogether. You anticipate the reaction and you plan around it -- not surrender at the mere *threat* of reprisal. China should know intimately by now that the empire is a paper tiger. The time for action has clearly arrived. To delay any further is a betrayal.",

And since none of the recognized religious institutions allow homosexuality, gay marriage is not allowed. https://t.co/ORXiVdeue5 \"But wait,\" you cry! \"Israel recognizes gay marriages performed in countries where it's legal!\"\n\nYes. Because Israel is a settler colonial enterprise. It requires a constant stream on immigration to continue its campaign of demographic displacement. It needs to entice wealthy, liberal, colonially-minded settlers from the imperial core, which means it needs to adopt the same liberal affectations as those cultures do. It needs all the imperial amenities, the cultural norms, the professional career prospects, and so on. So why does Israel *recognize* gay marriage while leaving family law in the hands of religious institutions? This too is an integral part of the colonial project. Israel relies on enforcement of the legitimacy and legal authority of Judaism in the construction of a Jewish state. The Rabbinical courts are an inextricable component of the Israeli justice system, with authority over the family -- the reproductive cell of cultural hegemony. Israel maintains strict religious control over marriage, divorce, status and care of children, inheritance, and more. The family is incredibly important to crafting culture and controlling the flow of capital in a society. It engenders allegiance to a constructed identity, modulates the transmission of wealth and education, instills obedience to the social order, and tamps down unrest. By investing all power over the family into a religious court, Israel legitimizes the supremacy of its Jewish settler population. Jewish strictures govern the very foundation of social life -- and through it, economic hegemony is reinforced. That is the nature of colonialism. They cannot legalize gay marriage -- or interfaith marriage, or secular marriage in general -- without undermining the absolute authority of the Rabbinate. While in the midst of its ongoing ethnic cleansing, this would collapse the colonial project.",

Billionaires trade carbon credits back and forth, garnering praise for the purchases, while sales are ignored. https://t.co/rE4ToebhdY There is no central standardization for what actually constitutes a \"carbon credit,\" with various certifying agencies maintaining basically no oversight at all: you basically just pay for a piece of paper that says you paid for that piece of paper. One type of carbon offset is measured by projecting the carbon capture of a parcel of forest, decades into the future. They might purchase land and plant a bunch of trees on it -- trees which will sequester very little carbon for the first several years of their lives. And again, there's no oversight that prevents that land from later being resold, those same trees being paved over for agriculture, industry, or urban development. The actual amount of carbon \"offset\" in this way could be a fraction of what was bragged about. That doesn't even touch on the hilarious ineffectiveness of these new growth forests that have no biodiversity, no stability, and are subject to their own ecological problems, like groundwater depletion, soil erosion, and increased risk of wildfires. And of course, there's also the outright graft, such as the holders of protected forestland selling carbon offsets representing the *exact same* parcel of land, or selling the \"protection\" of land that is already supposed to be protected from deforestation. It's all just a giant game the capitalists play, jockeying to win the most \"green morality\" points, without needing to divest themselves of the carbon-fueled economic system that empowers and elevates them to the top of the social hierarchy.",

Even without paying restitution for death and suffering, that would still include:\n\n-Land taken from native peoples.\n-Wages never paid to enslaved people.\n-Resources extracted from colonies. -Damages for infrastructure destroyed in wars.\n-Damages for economic development blocked by embargoes and sanctions.\n\n... to name a few.\n\nIt would fundamentally change the entire world, even before giving modern workers our due for stolen surplus labor. These damages would, of course, be extracted from the capitalists who have hoarded all this stolen wealth. In the course of revolution--if successful--many of those capitalists would of course flee, taking as much of their capital with them as they can. They would also bring with them as much of the US military as possible. Whatever place becomes their safe haven would naturally become the new center of global capital, and possibly global imperialism.\n\nThis is why revolution has to be international and ongoing. The capital flight from a revolutionary US would be qualitatively different from anything we saw from revolutions in Cuba, China, even Russia, with its incomplete capitalist development. The risk posed to the world by these displaced oligarchs could be catastrophic. This is one of the biggest reasons we can't just \"smash the state\" and be done with it. Chasing capital out of our borders is just the first step of revolution. We will need to end capitalism. Permanently.",

We WILL need to take actions that end up affecting ordinary people's comfort and well-being. \"Seize the means of production\" is not just a slogan. It is a description of the necessary reorganization of production and distribution into the hands of the working class. Capital will not simply concede these things to us. They will use violence--both physical and economic. This necessarily impacts innocent people. It will harm the most vulnerable first, for whom the system already says \"Pay us or suffer.\" Capitalism is the culprit. It has replaced social support with market \"solutions,\" gatekept by whether profit can be extracted from the service. Anyone who--for example--relies on delivery services to get groceries, is someone who will be *best* served by a non-market economy. They are also the first to have their tenuous privileges taken away when capitalists fight back. And communists need to be able to ensure support. This extends to all sectors of society, not just support for disabled comrades. The more we attempt to reclaim from capital, the more it will attempt to deprive us. We need to be able to provide food, water, homes, medicine, security, education, and much more. Until we are victorious, and control all production, we will never be able to provide *everything* for each other. Hence, we also need to inoculate our communities against the mind games capital will play. We need to equip communities to assess their real needs. And yes, in the course of a capitalist reaction to revolution, living standards will likely decline. We may have to go without GrubHub.\n\nIt's the job of communists to ensure that as much as possible, needs are met, lives are preserved, and sacrifices are made willingly.

The totality of the imperial apparatus -- especially settler colonialism -- is arranged to maintain and expand this status quo. Empire is not just about expanding the resources and labor available to capitalist production, but about *compelling* it, by edging out any alternative. The capitalist edifice necessarily creates not only a vast population of people who must sell their labor in exchange for wages, but a significant subpopulation of people *excluded* from being able to do so. The colonized, the criminalized, the ostracized, the disabled, etc. The downfall of economistic \"labor organizing\" is in ignoring the central role of the persistence of that precariat for the existence of the entire apparatus. To simply advance the standing of the \"workers\" without unseating the entire regime is to run an accelerating treadmill. As long as the colonial framework remains in place, capital can continue to dictate the terms of access to the means of survival. The more the working class works to negotiate its stability, the more the empire works to exclude people from that class. The \"workerists\" point to an ever-increasing pie in order to demand that workers deserve a larger piece. But if they organize hard enough to succeed in their demands, capital simply compensates by excluding more people from accessing the pie altogether. Fascism then can be described as the collection of the methods of that exclusion, and the enforcement of \"proletarian\" as a privilege. These methods have always existed as a necessary component of the capitalist system, they have simply undergone evolution in scope and form. The \"rise of fascism\" we're observing (visible even to liberals) is nothing more or less than yet more expansion of that scope in order to exclude an even broader population -- and intensify that exclusion -- from accessing the vaunted 40 Hour Work Week.",

        "smushed_text": "The inability of people to recognize the qualitative difference between executive authority vested in democratically-empowered centralized structures and rootless tyranny of self-aggrandizing opportunists is one of the deliberate goals of hegemonic bourgeois propaganda. It leads to a number of disempowering outcomes, forestalling movement-building:\n\n1. Distrust of the very concept of \"authority,\" since no leadership can be trusted to not be the opportunist type.\n\n2. Overeagerness to follow opportunists, believing they are the democratic type. 3. Credulous acceptance of any and all anticommunist propaganda, no matter how baseless or ridiculous, because it has been drilled into your head since birth that all of these movements were necessarily led by the opportunist type. 4. Unwavering investment in bourgeois \"democracy,\" out of the naive misconception that tepid assent on a ballot imbues \"representatives\" with democratic authority. In reality, a system in which capital governs social life has no room for any but the MOST opportunistic actors. Every major \"communist party\" or \"socialist organization\" in the west is rife with opportunism, because they do not fulfill the (admittedly very stringent) requirements to build a constituency capable of flexing their democratic will. This is due to a number of factors, but the primary one is a lack of political development of the membership.\n\nMost are also organizationally structured to preclude the ousting of opportunists, even while maintaining the same guise of \"democracy\" that governs capitalist states. In some cases, this structural anti-democracy runs so deep that it would be quite literally impossible to reform the organization. In others, the rampant liberalism almost acts as a blank slate on which communists could theoretically paint their democratic centralist vision. In all scenarios, politically naive revolutionaries-in-waiting will continue to be led astray by all manner of opportunists unless and until we build an organization that can demonstrate what real democracy looks like.",

This is how they've always justified the violence of the regime. The US was founded on \"We have to protect white babies against the native menace!\" As fascism developed, it added more mythemes into its arsenal, including explanations for any decline in prospects (real or perceived) for certain classes within the uber-nation -- something which *should* be impossible for a normally functioning, perfectly civilized nation. Namely, the existence of not just barbarians at the gates, but an alien influence that has managed to infiltrate and subvert the \"natural\" order in some way. \"The Jew,\" \"the queer,\" \"the oriental,\" or something more abstract -- the intelligentsia, the cosmopolitan, the financier. *These* groups are the ones presented as weak, effeminate, conniving, while still having the ability, when left unchecked, to manipulate society into an \"unnatural\" orientation, where might does *not* make right. Where the barbarians can no longer be dealt with \"appropriately.\" So to put all these threads together, the story goes:\n\n\"We used to be a nation of proud, strong men, who protected our precious children and women from the brutish races with the might of our noble police, proud military, and stalwart vigilantes. \"But we lost our way as a nation. Weak, effeminate, cosmopolitans tried to artificially elevate the savages to equal status. They opened the gates and turned loose the rabid criminals. They turned the cities into hellholes, and told us we can't do anything to fight back.\" There are so many other threads to weave into this delightful tapestry of fascist delusion, and I've barely touched on the material roots or outcomes of any of this.

They housed the program in churches, so that when the violent arm of the state came to bust them up (which they inevitably did), they could show the masses, \"See? Nothing is sacred to these pigs.\"\n\nThey enforced strict discipline in the volunteers--no tardiness, no stealing, etc. The nationwide program wasn't just a bunch of disparate groups imitating each other: it was a centrally-planned rollout, with specific protocols and democratic centralism as the core framework. Each program was tailored to local need, but implemented in concert with the national. It wasn't simply charity either. It formed the backbone of a mass line. Parents and children alike were educated on black liberation and Marxism-Leninism. The party learned from the people about specific community needs, while they taught the people about revolution in general. State oppression kept ramping up, not because they were simply feeding the people, but because of how they were doing it. The Black Panthers came the closest we've ever had in this country to building dual power. And of course they had to bend the rules to do it. They carried guns, made credible threats, organized the masses for collective action, and never compromised on their values.\n\nThe state was only able to defeat them back then because they didn't achieve a critical mass. We can certainly improve on their model.",

Organize under principles that make it clear why you are tackling this particular issue, what your horizons are, and why you organize in this way. Hardcode study directly into the bylaws. Invite interested \"radicals\" into the organization as supporters -- volunteers, donors, allies. Make it clear to them that membership in the broader organization will entail deliberate Marxist education, but that otherwise, any way they can help is always appreciated. The \"Marxists\" in your area will naturally be the ones who most eagerly move into the educational space, transitioning from mere volunteers to full members. These are the ones who were reluctant to join \"just another book club,\" but are invigorated by the org's material impact. With enough education, these \"Marxists\" will simply be actual Marxists, capable of leading and educating others. The vigor with which your org is able to provide materially for the community will attract more supporters, particularly from among those served by the org. More supporters means a greater pool of resources to expand the organization's programs. It also means there will be an influx of new members seeking further political development. This circuit can continue indefinitely, expanding the org's operational capabilities exponentially. It is only once enough of these local orgs have reached this level of maturity that we can say that the movement as a whole has developed enough for coalescence into a true communist party. Anyone attempting to call themselves \"the party\" in the absence of this is fooling you. I'm aware of only a handful of orgs in North America that are even on this path, and I'm sure all of them would agree that they haven't yet reached full maturity as a reproductive cell of communism. But they are certainly working towards it, and should be emulated. It takes a great deal of patience, which is hard to come by in the context of the urgency of the moment.

You have to completely toss out the vast majority of the genome to get that number. The \"99% similarity\" refers to *homologous genes*, of which we share a lot.\n\nFor example, humans and chumps both have the AMY1 gene, which is used to make amylase, an enzyme for digesting starch. Chimp and human amylases themselves have very similar structures and functions. However, chimps generally only have two copies of AMY1, while humans have a wide variety of different copies, with some populations having dozens. Recent population genetic studies have shown a correlation between historical dependence on grains and AMY1 copy number. It's not just the gene itself that matters, but how it's used. Genes are turned on or off, dialed up or down, their products modified and transported in different ways, all as part of an absurdly complicated regulatory system involving the \"junk DNA\" comprising 98% of our genome. Our supposed 99% similarity to chimps completely ignores that intricate dance of promoters and enhancers and microRNA and histone modification and DNA methylation and chromosomal fusion and so much more, all of which come together to make us wholly different species. Crucially, two of our ancestral chromosomes fused into one. Humans now have 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared to chimps' 24. Translocation events have also shuffled vital gene loci around. This means that during reproduction, the zygote would have mismatched gene pairs, and die. When liberals say \"focus on the 90% we agree on, not the 10% we don't,\" they are referring to superficial impressions of \"policy preferences,\" disregarding the ideological scaffolding underpinning the entire project as \"junk DNA.\" \"You want affordable healthcare, an end to climate change, and queer rights, same as us!\"\n\nWrong. Those are not things we \"want,\" like items on a shopping list, items we are prepared to bargain for. They are part of the foundation of our project. Our \"purity tests\" aren't about being petulant children who don't play well with others. It's simply recognition of what we are actually trying to do. Our goal is a world free from exploitation. Your goal is to soothe your troubled soul by feeling like you've \"made progress.\" A human and a chimpanzee cannot produce viable offspring together. Our respective genomes quite literally do not line up.\n\nIf we want to reproduce our ideology, we can only do that with those who share that ideological genome. Diversity is good, but we need the same chromosomes. What does \"genetic diversity\" look like in terms of ideology? For that, we look at the wide variety of liberation struggles across the world and throughout history. Revolutionary traditions that liberals reject out hand, acknowledging that they represent ideological speciation. We have more in common with Juche than we do with liberalism. We have more in common with the PFLP and than we do with Democrats. Our ideology is perfectly suited to producing viable offspring with those who share our (r)evolutionary niche. (In fact, just like in biological evolution, without embracing that diversity, our ability to adapt the ideology to our own environment is severely hampered. But that's a topic for a different discussion, one aimed at communists, not liberals.) As eager as liberals are to reject the \"horrors\" of liberation struggles, we are just as eager to reject liberals. We are not all part of the blob known as \"the left.\" We are communists. You complain when we reject you, but you detest who we really are. We have nothing in common.",

There is absolutely no conception here of what fascist paramilitaries are capable of, or how well-prepared and motivated they are. This is especially prominent in the sphere of moderately wealthy, white liberals, who have never really felt the impact of that statelessness-within-a-state. Nor do they truly feel the sting of the sheer contempt of the fascist ideology. They are philosophically opposed to the concept of bigotry, but ill-equipped for the reality of the organized savagery of unabashed fascism.\n\nThey are totally unaware that merely being non-bigoted puts them on the radar of the fascists too. And since they have never experienced violence, it feels totally foreign. They may, for example, empathize with the victims of police brutality, but still feel safe in the knowledge that that's just something that other people go through.\n\nThat will change sooner than you think. They use the phrase \"vulnerable communities,\" generally in an earnest expression of empathy and a desire to protect. It's not even on their radar that they too could be made vulnerable in an instant and need protection themselves. An unfortunate number of white Jews fall into this category, not understanding that, yes, today's fascists still see Jews as foreign, subversive, and necessary to exterminate. The belief that leftism is a Jewish ploy is alive and well in these circles. Expect anything and everything to be an excuse for violence. It's unclear if even European immigrants will be spared--certainly not those who reject fascism.\n\nThis is not hyperbole: these people are actively preparing for war, and the state has no plans to deal with them. The point in all this is not to denigrate or say these people are weak and inherently unable to fight.\n\nThe point is that there must be a plan to teach resilience, to integrate shellshocked liberal victims, and to combat their instinct to just bunker down and hope for the best.",

        "smushed_text": "The story of the Exodus is the foundation myth of the ancient Hebrews. It's the story of ethnogenesis, which is a concept that applies to basically every culture in human history. The archaeological record of early Hebrews specifically is pretty scant, but there are some clues. There are records of ancient Near East peoples, some of which seemed to have worshipped a sort of proto-Yahweh. The 18th dynasty of Egypt conquered and ruled over this territory in the 14th century BCE, which seems to be an obvious source of the idea of \"slavery to Egypt\". Leading up to the bronze age collapse, Egypt's control over the region waned, both due to internal domestic turmoil and persistent rebellions in the region. My guess is that, during this time, the cultural group who would come to be known as the Hebrews grew in influence. They would come to exert dominance over the other ethnic groups as Egypt withdrew, eventually leading to the tribal confederation of Israelites. This confederation would, over the next few centuries, coalesce into the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. (Side note: in the Hebrew Bible, the beginning of Israel is portrayed as starting with a united monarchy under a series of divinely-annointed kings, which eventually underwent a north-south schism. But again, there's no corroborating evidence of anything pre-two kingdoms.) As these polities solidified, folk tales, religious traditions, and oral history would have given rise to this ex post facto reading of \"Egypt used to rule us, then they got ousted\" as \"We were slaves in Egypt, then our God freed us and told us to conquer the Promised Land.\" Chronologically, the earliest text in the Tanakh comes from Judges, which was likely the period when an increasingly organized religious order would have been exerting cultural power during this pre-kingdom stage. This may have been the beginning of formal Hebrew religious unity. The formula for all the Judges in the text is as follows:\n\n- Israelites stray from Yahweh\n- Yahweh delivers them into the hands of enemies\n- Yahweh elevates someone as a spiritual and military leader\n- This Judge defeats the enemy\n- Israelites return to Yahweh, under the Judge. A sociological interpretation of this can be as allegory, with Judges being both prominent military leaders and cultural hegemons, uniting an emerging culture under both religious and political rule during a period when external administrative rule was on its back feet. The Song of Deborah is a victory hymn, detailing the triumph of Israelite tribes over the Canaanites, and is dated by some to the 12th century BCE. This may be the earliest text compiled into the compendium of Jewish tradition, specifically because of its foundational relevance. Others date all of the text of Judges, including Song of Deborah, to the 8th century BCE. But whether this latter authorship is true or not, it makes the most sense that the late bronze age Judges period was formative in the establishment of a distinct Israelite identity. Again, due to the paucity of the corroborating historical record, a lot of this is simply speculation; a narrative that *I* think gives a satisfying context to *why* these stories would have been considered authoritative by the compilers of the Tanakh. The earliest period of Jewish history I feel confident calling \"definitely historical\" is the Hasmonean period, which is the earliest period NOT included in the biblical canon. It's likely that this is when the canon was established, including the national foundation myth.",

Never having to swallow the torment of an abusive workplace because you can't afford to quit. Never having to hide from a bigoted landlord who might illegally refuse a lease, knowing lawsuits are beyond your reach. Moreover, the unifying Trans Experience\u2122\ufe0f is undercut by a divergence in class instincts. Where do your loyalties lie? Does your wealth orient you toward a protective impulse to the status quo that enriches you? Or do you feel every lick of oppression and seek its destruction? In the wealthy trans people, we can clearly see how it's possible to be advantaged in some ways by a system that still causes you harm. But how do you treat that harm? As an aberration that needs to be fixed? Or as a symptom of a terminal disease that must be expunged entirely? Not being able to see the gulf between the rich and the poor trans experience implies the former. The instinct is that being oppressed is made *somewhat* easier or harder based on how \"fortunate\" you happen to be, and that all that needs to change is a cultural shift. \"If only our society would just learn to accept trans people, then rich and poor alike would be able to transition in peace!\" That is a conclusion that can only come from wealth. It orients you in a distinctly non-oppositional direction to the status quo.\n\nThat is the difference.",

This prevents the virus from replicating effectively, but doesn't kill it. Normally, preventing a virus from replicating would be sufficient to end the infection. But SARS-CoV-2 is special. It can lay in wait for quite a while then resume its activities. So after the normal course of treatment, the drug degrades, and the virus can resurge. This has to do with its ability to evade immune detection by suppressing the \"Hey, there's a virus in here!\" MHC pathway. Which is also why the vaccines aren't very good at preventing transmission. Once the virus sets up shop, it can stay undetected and spread at its leisure. Hence the lunacy of Biden's message of \"I got COVID, and I'm still working! I don't even need a mask!\"\n\nThe most powerful tools we have *still* remain: tightly-sealed respirators, air filtration, contact tracing, and quarantining until you are completely clear of the virus.",

My point is part of a larger model about the interplay between the virus and the immune response. Obviously humoral immunity fades over time. (1/?) @natproach So if you get vaccinated or infected, then get exposed again to the exact same strain 6 months later, the initial stages of the infection progress very similarly to naive individuals. You'll likely be fine due to later cell-mediated immunity, but you still got it. (2/?) @natproach Which means you also potentially spread it during that initial period (if you didn't get tested quickly and had the means to stay home until you were negative). The result might not be death, but the virus continues to bounce around in the population. (3/?) @natproach The same thing happens even if your humoral immunity is still online from recent exposure, but the virus infecting you is distinct enough (while still having the ability to bind ACE2 and enter cells). Again in this scenario, you give the virus space to spread and mutate. (4/?) @natproach So what I'm predicting is a scenario where there's a constant wave of variants that only need to be distinct from the most recent variant to escape that initial immune response. We could see variants surge, then go into hiding, then reemerge 6 months later. Forever.",

Referendums were held across each of the occupied sectors on the question of expropriating the large landowners and industrialists who had supported the Third Reich. In the Soviet zone, voters passed with overwhelming majorities the resolutions to transfer these lands and industries into public ownership, so they did. The same majorities were in favor of the measures in US and British zones. Perplexed, the US occupying forces pushed for another referendum. This one passed with an even larger majority.\n\nFearing the spread of socialist ideals, US and British occupiers opted to simply ignore the public, and leave this economic power in the hands of Nazi collaborators. I'm skipping over the Potsdam Agreement because we should all already be familiar with the fact that the west was perfectly amenable to housing literal Nazis to allow them to escape justice for their war crimes. In fact, while the GDR was led by a constant stream of Jewish avowed antifascists, the exact opposite was true in the west.\n\nOver 1,000 officials from top to bottom of the Western German government had been high-ranking members of the Nazi party. All of this because the western powers, especially the US, decided they preferred fascism to socialism. They secretly rearmed West Germany, cut off vital trade to the east, and pumped billions of Marshall Plan dollars into the privatized economy explicitly to stem socialism.",

        "smushed_text": "Hank is right: it's not easy. It's simple, but certainly not easy.\n\nThe simple explanation at the root of the housing crisis is that housing is treated as a commodity. Just like in real life, the roots are tangled and branching and dirty, but the commodity form is at the center. https://t.co/0ISQ7RzYUy In turn, commodified housing is one manifestation of the most powerful tools of maintaining capitalist hegemony: the theft of the commons. Housing is something that is non-negotiable for survival, just like food, water, and medicine: the means of survival. All class societies rely on some degree of alienation of the majority from the means of survival in order to compel production on behalf of the ruling classes in control of those means of survival. At some level (obfuscated by layers of superstructure) this requires violence. Under capitalism, the enclosure of the commons is so comprehensive that it is next to impossible to survive without contributing to the capitalist mode of production. That is, the vast majority MUST work for a wage in order to purchase access to essentially ALL means of survival. Under this paradigm, where housing is both something used to generate capital directly and the primary means of survival which the working classes must work in order to access, it is impossible to abolish homelessness through building MORE commodified housing. The commodity form is so naturalized in our society that its persistence is taken as an immutable fact of life. Calls to even meagerly combat capital's grip on the means of survival are seen as \"intellectually lazy,\" and \"solutions\" that maintain that dominance are \"realistic.\" Yes, slogans like \"Just give people houses!\" are oversimplified. The path to decommodification is complicated, fraught with violence, and certainly doesn't obey the prescriptions of a legal system designed to enforce the theft of the commons.\n\nBut we need to start somewhere. We start by challenging the conceptual paradigm inflicted on us, that housing is something to be bought, sold, temporarily leased, and taken away as punishment for poverty. This is not an immutable fact of life: it is a legally, culturally, and violently reproduced status quo. It's not intellectually lazy to have a historically-informed ideology, with a horizon beyond our cloistered present. It's not idealism to reckon with the impermanence of the material forces that shape our society. It's not childish to strive to build the future.",

We'll always have to fight for liberation until the day we are liberated. Today has become the best time to do that. Yesterday would have been better, but yesterday is over. https://t.co/gaPhSm3U0C The image you're conjuring of a \"better time\" to be trans was a brief period with scattered pockets of facile, liberal \"acceptance.\" Acceptance is not and has never been liberation. It's putting makeup on the bruises. It's \"I'm sorry baby, I didn't mean it\" in the cycle of abuse. The supposed \"reprieve\" was never a stable, holistic reversal of the conditions that created the abuse in the first place. Depending on what material forces govern your existence, you may have *never* known that reprieve at all.\n\nhttps://t.co/xBod0YZ5dQ Other oppressed cohorts, especially oppressed nationalities, have shared in this experience you are now facing. Shifting *cultural* attitudes toward *some* members of a social class that allows *some* of them to escape abject immiseration. But it's all tenuous. There was a time when, among \"enlightened, respectable liberals,\" it was not ok to be transphobic, to be racist, to use the \"no-no words,\" to outright support eliminationist policies.\n\nYou could, of course, be \"tough on crime,\" \"tough on immigration,\" \"tough on China,\" etc. The seamlessness with which the liberal mainstream can become acculturated to abandoning their conception of pluralism by simply shifting the conversation isn't shocking. The only reason \"diversity as a value\" existed in the first place was to maintain bourgeois hegemony. \"Acceptance\" is a house of cards, built on the shaky ground of assimilation. All it takes to knock it over is a sizable, economically powerful faction stomping in unison that they refuse to even accept assimilation. Their interests were always more important than ours. That is why we don't fight for acceptance. We fight for liberation. We fight to completely strip away the power of capital, because as long as capital exists, those who hold it dictate who and what is even allowed to *exist*, let alone thrive. And yes, despite some scattered concessions to \"pluralism\" that have allowed a few outsiders, to grab some for themselves, capital remains to this day predominantly in the hands of those who first carved it from the flesh of everyone else. And they have a death grip on it. So no, you did not become trans at the worst time to be trans. Now is the best time to be trans, because now is the only time we have.\n\nNow is the time to join the fight for liberation.",

        "smushed_text": "Yes, everyone should be doing whatever they personally can to avoid getting infected and infecting others. Most want to. But what out-of-touch elites can't see is that, for the vast majority, every decision comes with a cost-benefit analysis. Even things that seem like obvious choices are really difficult decisions. Sometimes, those decisions are rational, sometimes emotional, sometimes based on misinformation. But at the end of the day, decisions are being made that policymakers can't even conceive of having to make. Take the choice to get vaccinated for example. It's free, it's safe, it works, so it should be a no-brainer, right?\n\nBut what if you're not sure it's actually free? You're uninsured, and you're used to every medical procedure having some hidden, often huge, cost. What if you're undocumented and no matter what assurances you get, you're afraid vaccine records might be used to deport you and your family?\n\nWhat if you've been burned before by needing to wait in line longer than expected, and got your pay docked, or even got fired? Plus, almost no one is actually *required* to get vaccinated (some are required to get tested if they're unvaxxed), so maybe it's not that big of a deal? If it was so important, they'd make you do it, like seatbelts, or like MMR for public schools. Or take masks. At first, you were told masks don't work. Then you were told masks work, but they should be saved for HCWs. Then you were told cloth masks work just fine, and so you started wearing one.\n\nThen you were told that if you're vaxxed, you don't have to wear them. Restaurants opened back up for in-person dining, so obviously masks weren't necessary anymore. Even as delta started surging, masks were still optional almost everywhere.\n\nWith omicron, more emphasis was put on masks again, but you started hearing that maybe cloth isn't enough. They're saying what really works is N95, but those are expensive and you can't find any. Plus, the official guidance still says cloth is ok, so why would you \"make the personal choice\" to spend the time and money to get your hands on the \"better\" masks? The most critical of these \"personal choices\" is the decision to stay home. It's also the easiest to understand why people aren't just doing of their own accord. There is absolutely no support for people isolating when infected, let alone preemptively isolating out of caution. COVID leave is a thing of the past for those who even had it at all. Even \"white collar\" jobs that instituted a special policy, where isolating for COVID wouldn't take away from your ordinary PTO have stopped doing that. And for many, PTO, or even unpaid leave was never a thing. The best you could ever hope for was that isolating for COVID wouldn't get you fired. You'd take the CDC's recommended 10 days without getting paid, and the good employers would let you come back afterward. For many, those 10 days off put you in the red instantly. When the CDC says 5 days is fine \"if symptoms are improving,\" you, who are not a virologist, might assume you're fine. Especially since they say not to bother testing again so you can get back to work. Even if you wanted to keep isolating, your boss says get back to work. So when the message from the government is that everyone needs to just \"make good decisions,\" after giving people so little support to make those decisions, what they're really saying is they have no idea what life is like for the people they rule.",

Don't worry: it's not irrational! It's a calculated allocation of resources toward maintaining the empire.

The abundant goods that flow into your life do so on a red sea of blood. It goes so much deeper than you could possibly imagine if you're just starting from a place of being vaguely \"anti-war.\" Most of this brutal imperial maintenance happens without you even seeing bombs fall. If you're outside the US, it may not even be *your* country that drops the bombs. But it is still you who the bombs serve. The imperial system works very hard to convince you that this is the natural state of affairs. It tries to give you hope that outright war is an aberration. But it's not natural. Your way of life is paid for with bullets and bombs. The bananas, the microchips, the clothing, the fuel, the pre peeled garlic -- everything. Liberation will abrogate ALL the spoils of empire.

When we free the world, you will still have bananas, but they will no longer be stolen.\n\nYour education starts by asking yourself: \"How badly do I want to maintain this lopsided exchange?\"\n\nThe way you answer is the difference between fascism and revolution.",

        "smushed_text": "It's not a \"lack of discipline\" that precludes people from \"self-improvement,\" especially in the realm of physical exertion.\n\n\"Know your limits and work to push past them\" doesn't work if you are you are limited by invisible conditions.\n\nHere's an illustration: You've always been an \"average person.\" Not exactly a powerlifter, but you exercise intermittently. You've had ups and downs throughout your life, periods of being in decent shape, periods where you've slacked off, not paid enough attention to your diet. But overall, healthy. Most recently, you were going through a period of more deliberate self-improvement. Going on longer walks every day, cutting out fast food and minimizing sugar, you even got some strength training equipment for home workouts. You were proud of your progress. A few months ago, you got COVID.\n\nYou've been pretty careful: you always wear a mask to work, you don't eat in restaurants, and you're pretty sure you can trust your friends to do the same, so you're fine being relaxed and unmasked around them.\n\nSomehow, though, you got it. It wasn't the most sick you've ever been, but you know that's not the only danger from COVID. You know it's important to let your body fully recover. After a few days, the symptoms seem to have completely passed, other than a little lethargy. Walks become short and sporadic, you aren't doing your strength training, and you prioritize rest.\n\nAfter a couple of months though, you come to the realization of how far you've regressed. You're being too idle these days. It's time to get back in shape! You're not *that* disappointed that you get exhausted more easily and aren't as strong as before. Totally natural after such a gap. But you know that the only way to regain your losses is to just power through. Progressive overload! Push your boundaries! One day, empowered by an inspirational post on twitter, exhorting people to get stronger to better serve their communities and defeat the fascists, you go as hard as you can. It's been months since your infection, you're feeling better, and you want to finally surpass yourself. But you are clearly hitting a wall. You're getting exhausted and you're still not where you were before. But you know the only way to improve is to power through. It's a struggle, and you juuuust miss your old personal best.\n\nFrustrating. But you're at least almost there. You take a rest day, as prescribed for maximum gains. And frankly, you both need and deserve it. You pushed so hard that you can barely move. Maybe you overdid it a bit. You resolve to pace yourself in the future -- gains should be slow and steady. You still feel weak the following day, but you know that's just your body adjusting. You'd been idle for so long, and you've really only been back on your regimen for a few weeks.\n\nConsistency is key, though. So even though you really don't feel like it, you can't be lazy today. You focus on cardio instead of weights. Gotta balance consistent exercise with avoiding overdoing it. Slow and steady.\n\nToday is a SLOG. Incredibly frustrating. You started off on a run, not even planning to go as far as you usually do. But you're out of breath halfway through. After a few minutes of walking to catch your breath, you get back up to speed... then crash again. What the hell? Did you really over-exert yourself so much the other day??\n\nThe walk back home is slow and painful. You collapse into bed. You'll just have to try again tomorrow. At this point, let's shift perspectives from you to your body.\n\nIf you were to test your serum and urine metabolome, you'd find a sharp deficit of hypoxanthine compared to the average, indicating a glycolytic anomaly that directly correlates to the intense crash you're feeling. Urine excretion of methylhistidine, mannitol, and acetate would be off the charts. You're not just tired: you're experiencing hypoacetylation and excessive muscle catabolism.\n\nIn response to the exertion, your muscles are literally breaking down. In the coming weeks, you grow ever more frustrated with yourself. Your workouts are getting more and more exhausting. Even when you push yourself harder, you only ever seem to backslide further. You take more rest days, which makes you feel lazy, so you push hard again later. But it's not working. This goes against every bit of common sense. You're working harder, but getting weaker.  That's not how it works.\n\nYou decide to see a doctor. First you try your GP, who gives you a checkup. He says \"This might be psychological\" and gives you a referral. You briefly ponder the psychological aspect, but you doubt that's it. When you first got back into exercising, you had been incredibly motivated. You've always been able to pump yourself up and get moving, you've just been getting physically exhausted too quickly. Next, you try a specialist, who came highly recommended by a friend. She interviews you about your experiences, tests your breathing, your heart rate, your stamina, your blood, your flexibility, all sorts of things you hadn't even thought of. Once all the results are in, she gives you the verdict:\n\n\"You have chronic fatigue syndrome.\"\n\nYou have a million questions. You've heard people talking about things like ME/CFS, chronic pain, and such on twitter. You've had empathy for the disabled. But that's not you, right? You get checkups all the time, and even got genetic testing done at one point. You've never been told you have any risk factors for anything. You haven't had any serious injuries. You don't smoke or do drugs.\n\n\"So what's the treatment?\"\n\nShe looks at you, sympathy in her eyes. There is no cure. There is no treatment. The only recommendations made by medical agencies are to avoid overexertion and to get treatment for depression and anxiety.\n\nThis is your reality now. It's the shocking, new reality for tens of millions more people every year since the start of the pandemic. Most of whom don't even realize it. The symptoms and disease progression are highly variable and recognizing them is very difficult to do when awareness is so minimal. The impact this disease has can be intermittent, subtle, delayed, and very slow. But it does eventually catch up with you. And fighting against that slow decline by powering through with progressive overload is disastrous. The problem isn't that you're not working hard enough. It's that your biochemistry has been altered, and now you break down muscle faster than you repair it.\n\nYour only option now is to take a step back from exertion.\n\nYou need to be disciplined.",

And \"You can always push yourself to get stronger\" leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, as someone deeply versed in the physiology and biochemistry of chronic fatigue, a condition that is rapidly swallowing a population being constantly reinfected with COVID. You CAN'T always get stronger with exercise. You might literally get weaker. You can exacerbate the chronic effects of long COVID -- a condition you might not even realize you have until you suddenly find yourself unable to run or hike as much as you used to. That is what the literature is revealing  as the canonical progression: individuals recovering from acute illness, getting \"back on the grind,\" noticing they're a bit weaker now, pushing themselves to regain their losses, and steadily getting weaker and weaker. Sorry if that's not something you want to hear. Sorry if it goes counter to the liberal idealism and \"common sense\" you've been immersed in all your life. But, due to circumstances you can't perceive with the naked eye, you might not be able to \"power through.\" The bargain of \"work harder, achieve gains\" is completely broken by chronic conditions that only become obvious once you notice that disconnect.\n\nInternalize that, and do it quickly. Because COVID is rampant. If you personally are trying to get and stay fit, prevention is step 1. Our movement needs to reckon with that before we can even begin to think about how we build a fighting force.\n\nWe certainly have to stop trying to make judgements about the \"fitness\" of individual communists.

The last of them to arrive in the US did so just a few years before the Bolshevik revolution. I often wonder about the other way things could have gone. I obviously don't blame them for wanting to get out and build a better life. Generations of oppression are no small trauma: raids, murder, theft, rape, restricted movement, exclusion from social life, and utter economic despondency were their lot in life. And yet... there will always be a part of me that thinks \"If only they had been a bit more brave, they could have been revolutionaries.\" They could have been the first generation of a new era, ushering in the world's first socialist state. I could have a proud Soviet heritage. Or they could have been slaughtered in the white terror. Or the Nazi invasion.\n\nEither way, I would have been born during Shock Therapy, and my lot in life would have been a lot worse. It's no use thinking about alternate history. But it does still guide my priorities. I don't think I could ever make that same choice for myself. I couldn't just pack up and flee to greener pastures, literally or metaphorically. I have to stay and fight -- because the fight will happen with or without me. And I don't want to be the chump who abandoned the cause.",

        "smushed_text": "I love about the phrase \"grassroots organizing\" because of the evolutionary history of grass.\n\n60 million years ago, there was no such thing as grass. Trees were everywhere, using a strategy of growing tall and capturing all the sunlight before any ground plants could get any. A breakthrough was made when a particular plant evolved to have its meristem (the part from which the rest of the plant grows) underground, protecting it from danger.\n\nThis was the beginning of the \"grassroots\" model: shield your means of growth and you'll do well. This meant that the grassroots were protected from predation by herbivores, unlike other shrubs and trees, so they kept reproducing while less resilient species got eaten.\n\nHowever, as grass started to overtake the other low-lying plants, it came up against the massive trees. To combat these energy-sucking goliaths, grass evolved a new strategy: after spreading its seeds, grass started *deliberately* drying out and even releasing flammable gasses to encourage the spread of wildfires. Fires swept through grassy forests, consuming the trees and the grass tops alike. But that precious meristem of the grassroots was protected, unlike those of the trees.\n\nAfter every wildfire, more and more trees were wiped out, while the grass was able to recover from its roots. Grass therefore has an evolutionary history of burning down an entrenched system of trees that tries to hoard all the life force, growing itself and starving all else. It does so literally at the grassroots level, through careful self-maintenance and spreading literal fire. We should all be like the grassroots. Don't let yourself get picked off, take whatever resources you can, use them to grow slowly, until a fire sweeps through, spurred on by all your united allies, to tear down the systems of oppression.",

        "smushed_text": "A pernicious mythology that has flourished largely unchallenged in both the public consciousness and the medical profession is the concept of the immune system as being \"strengthened\" by infections. The idea goes that your immune system starts off inexperienced and vulnerable, but through exposure to various pathogens, it becomes generally better at fighting pathogens. It's envisioned as a military being hardened through combat experience. This isn't entirely wrong: your immune system has an entire branch -- out of several branches -- dedicated to \"adaptive immunity.\" It stores fragments of pathogens (or rather, what it *thinks* are pathogens) and uses them to create targeted responses specific to that antigen. However, this is NOT something that makes your immune system \"stronger.\" It's more like differentiation -- the process of cells and tissues changing to be able to perform a highly specialized job. They forgo the ability to adapt in order to get better suited to one task. Think of how every* cell in your body contains the same* DNA, but eye cells and liver cells perform completely different jobs. As you develop, cells in different parts of your body are exposed to different biochemical signals and develop into different cell types. Throughout the process of differentiation, cells pass various thresholds after which they can't go backwards and develop differently. Eye cells can never* become any other cell type once they've fully matured. And that's good! Otherwise, your eyes would get messed up! A good analogy is the way we specialize into fields of expertise. We start off with no education or experience, then we might go to college for biology, then we might go to grad school and learn developmental biology, then a postdoc in the differentiation of eye cells, etc. The more specialized you get, the better you are at accomplishing your niche thing. But that comes at the cost of your potential to specialize in other things. A 50-year-old tenured professor is no longer that fresh-faced high school graduate exploring their options. Of course, as people, we *could* always go back and start training in a new field, adding to our experience. It's never too late to learn new things. But it's certainly much harder for that professor to start a new career from scratch and gain that same level of expertise again. Looking back at the immune system, the process is MUCH more grueling than human specialization. Colleges don't typically slaughter the bottom 95% of the class. Immune cells are expected to become HIGHLY specialized, very quickly. Especially during an acute infection. Specialization of immune cells is just one aspect of adaptive immunity among many, many others. And even adaptive immunity itself is just one branch of the astonishingly complex immune system, most of which has nothing to do with \"training\" on specific pathogens. Some components don't even have a clue about the difference between viruses and bacteria. Some can be dumb enough to think a peanut protein or a microgram of gluten is a dangerous toxin that needs to be expunged NOW, RIGHT NOW, EVEN IF IT KILLS US, WE WILL TAKE IT DOWN WITH US. Your immune system is also not a limitless supply. Even though your body is constantly breaking down and refreshing old parts and generating new cells and molecules, this process degrades over time. This is why older people have *weaker* immune systems, not stronger. If your immune system was an elite fighting force, constantly getting better with every victory, our elders would have the strongest immune systems of all of us. Instead, a lifetime of fighting has caused their immune systems to begin to lose steam. Not only are their physical reserves running low due to diminished capacity to resupply, what they have has been \"trained\" on enemies that they aren't facing. We are constantly bombarded with new pathogens. Some are entirely novel (like when COVID first emerged). But most are just new versions of things you've kinda seen before. In the 80 years since your first flu, the strain you \"trained\" on has evolved through more generations than those separating us from gorillas. Could a retired marine squad fight a bunch of armed hypergorillas? During especially nasty acute infections, it's all hands on deck. The immune system goes into overdrive trying to figure out how to deal with this existential threat, nuance and restraint be damned. Who knows if you'll live to see another infection, THIS needs to be dealt with! Your immune system, quite simply, is never the same again after an ordeal like that. It is primed to fight a particular enemy, resources have been expended willy-nilly, collateral damage has been wrought, and it can be hard to even transition out of that \"total war\" mode. Especially for pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, which can linger for a loooong time. You might *feel* better, but your immune system is still hard at work. And it's still \"training.\"\n\nSometimes, it makes mistakes during this protracted response. It misidentifies enemies. Autoimmunity is still poorly understood, but one aspect of it is essentially that various parts of your immune system, already primed to fight a seemingly-omnipresent enemy, go haywire trying to identify enemies, and lock onto bits of *your own body* as valid targets. They can specialize in targeting harmless, normal human cells, and never be satisfied that the infection is gone: they keep triggering waves of attack, as long as the \"enemy\" refuses to go away -- because it's YOU they're fighting! In addition to damage being done to those particular tissues being targeted, this also drains your resources even more. You feel sick and weak, even when you aren't infected. When you do get infected with something new, your immune system's attention is divided. This is all just a tiny, oversimplified snapshot of some of the dynamics at play in the immune system. It's unbelievably complex, arguably the most complex system in your entire body, the most highly variable between individuals and populations, a key focus of our evolution. The immune system is not something to be taken for granted. It's not some limitless resource to be drawn upon constantly. It's not even close to infallible, and makes way more mistakes than you imagine. It's certainly not a muscle to be exercised and made stronger.\n\nProtect it. *These are generalizations. The human body is extraordinarily complex and subject to all sorts of weird stuff going on. Somatic mutations, cancer, ectopic tissue formation, and so on, make this all impossible to present as being 100% true 100% of the time.",

Instead, the state owns the means of production. Instead of relying on a wage to survive, the workers receive what they need directly from the state. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon The difference between the two is not in the benefits of employment, nor in the degree to which workers' living conditions are bolstered by state taxation. Rather it is in the extent to which private ownership and profit motive dictate production. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon A state which regulates and taxes private enterprise to improve working and living conditions is simply holding back the worst excesses of capitalism while maintaining the core power dynamic. This is a practical concern in a number of ways, not just a moral one. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon The first is that this maintains a system in which production is organized around that which generates the most profit, not the most social good. If the capitalist determines that he can get more profit off an inferior product, he will oblige his workers to create subpar goods. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon If it is more profitable to use environmentally destructive practices, capitalism enforces that destruction. A regulatory state may attempt to temper that... but then it just becomes profitable to influence public perception and buy off governments. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon That leads into the second main problem with maintaining capitalism under social democracy: the social gains are ephemeral. By allowing capitalists to continue holding their economic and social power, you are giving them free reign to use that power to undo social democracy. @theguinnessking @AWindwardMaroon We see this in those precious European societies which instituted social democratic reforms in the past, but which have since seen those efforts undone by \"pragmatic\" and \"level-headed\" neoliberals. Those politicians rose to power on the backs of capitalist support.",

Capital screens which books get published, which research gets grants, which politicians stand a chance of getting elected, and which experts they listen to. Capitalists see the problem of biosphere collapse and even when they do acknowledge that the system that empowers them is the cause, their instinct is to figure out ways to maintain their power first, and then, if possible, address the symptoms of the climate change disease. They use their tremendous resources and prestige to flood the \"marketplace of ideas\" with fake solutions. Finagling the tax code, market-based solutions, feel-good consumer options...

ACP does the opposite of this by appealing to and entrenching those who have the most to gain by the maintenance of the status quo. The mention of \"even a construction company?\" leads me to believe your mistake is in equating \"doing stuff\" with \"running a business.\"\n\nCommunists *should* be building, farming, etc. These are projects orgs must run, to build a productive engine that isn't bound up in capital. Running a business -- extracting surplus value from workers, governing production by the logic of capital valorization -- does the exact opposite. It is no different from any other capitalist enterprise, just because the capitalist happens to say \"By the way, I'm a communist.\" The philosophy of the ACP revolves around the same axis as the broader society. It's entirely aesthetic, a \"communist\"-themed branding with no oppositional politics. \"Start your business\" is just one iteration of giving members \"permission\" to act exactly as they would otherwise. Their audience is people who want to enrich themselves, to *ascend* the social hierarchy, rather than destroying it. Positioning literal capitalism as somehow \"anticapitalist\" is the same rhetorical strategy they use to launder chauvinist views as \"real communism.\" The group views queerness as \"unnatural,\" opposes immigration as \"destabilizing,\" holds bioessentialist views of the roles of women and men, panders to white supremacist fears of a racialized \"criminal element,\" and so on.

This involves a transformation of the character and scale of material relations, in terms of both production and reproduction. \"Character of material relations\" refers to: the way in which production is performed in aggregate (mode of production); the way labor is compelled to perform production (access to means of survival); and the ways in which production is able to recapitulate and expand its inputs. That latter category is crucial, because it largely determines how we can consider the historical positioning of a given social structure. We can conceive of societies as being more or less developed based on the ways in which they reproduce and expand their economic production. We can illustrate this with contrasting examples:\n\nSociety A is an exaggerated slave society. All of its production is militaristic: it uses slave labor to produce weapons, uses the weapons to invade other lands, and brings back food, metal, and more slaves to repeat the process. In this example, society A does not reproduce its own material inputs or even labor power. Its productive circuit is entirely reliant on the predation of other societies -- ones which do reproduce those things -- and applying the surplus it seizes toward more conquest. A's growth relies not on expanding *production*, but on expanding its ability to seize the product of *others'* production. It does not develop new means of production -- everything produced is either food to nourish soldiers or weapons to equip them. Contrast this with society B, which is a largely agricultural society. Nearly every working person is involved in the production of food, but there is enough surplus that some are able to work on other production, such as the manufacturing of agricultural equipment. As time goes on, the manufacturing class builds more and more means of agricultural production, allowing the agricultural class to produce a greater surplus. This means that it is possible for a greater proportion of the working classes to perform non-agricultural labor. Society B is progressive in comparison to society A, not because \"slavery is morally wrong,\" but because A's production relies on a constant stream of primitive accumulation, while B's output is able to expand internally, by intensifying production. It is totally possible, for a time, for society A to grow even faster than B -- in fact, if B never produces sufficient military infrastructure, A could simply conquer B, seize all of its production, and transition B to A's economic system. This wholesale conquest, of course, would not be \"progressive.\" From A's perspective, its wealth has just immediately ballooned, and it even has ready-made manufacturing infrastructure that it can convert to weapons manufacturing. But the social *system* itself has regressed. The capacity of A to reproduce its (comparatively regressive) mode of production has, itself, progressed. But it has done so at the expense of a social system that had greater potential for intensifying production and expanding output even faster. The conquest cannot be said to have \"set society A on an accelerated path toward future higher modes of production,\" because that relies on abstract counterfactuals -- hypotheses which are necessarily untestable. What we *can* do is test hypotheses about general rules of the development of various societies in different contexts. Specifically relevant to this discussion is how societies develop depending on their ability to rely on continuous primitive accumulation. And when we do, a clear pattern emerges: a society in which there is a constant availability of fresh land, fresh resources, and fresh labor will tend to prioritize the *capture* of those things, rather than intensifying the use of land, resources, and labor it already controls. In the context of North America, the war of independence was not about untethering the colonists from a regressive social system back in Britain; instead, it freed them to pursue unchecked primitive accumulation in the form of westward expansion. We can see this pretty clearly in the development of industrial capitalism in Britain, which was already underway by the time of the war of independence. It would take the US another *century* to catch up to the economic output of Britain, despite conquering an entire continent. This is directly attributable to the economic model of the now-independent settler colony. It did not develop a more progressive economic model, because it didn't have to. Its ruling class could expand their wealth most quickly through acquiring more land, more slaves. Before the war, the colonies exported a fairly diverse array of primary resources back home -- tobacco, grain, lumber, fish, iron, rum, etc.\n\nBy 1815, cotton had risen to the top.\n\nBy 1840, cotton exports were worth more than ALL other exports combined. Following independence, the US had expanded slavery and genocidal land seizures to transform itself into the cotton capital of the world -- particularly on behalf of Britain, which was the *textile* capital. The north took nearly a century to start industrializing. The US civil war, then, *was* progressive. It was the culmination of the divergence of economic interests of the north and the south -- the former developing its economy primarily through intensification, the latter through primitive accumulation. It was only following the civil war and the forceful end of the regressive institution of slavery that the US began to truly put its century-long bonanza of enclosure to use in industrializing.\n\nOf course, there was still much more genocide, exploitation, and expansion to go. The US's transition to industrial capitalism was demonstrably not advanced by its independence from Britain. Quite the contrary -- the south outright regressed, and the north took decades to even come close to the level of development attained in Europe. The only reason 1776 is ever upheld as \"progressive\" is out of pure idealism, romanticizing the spectacle of a colony breaking away from its progenitor. But this act alone did not alter its class dynamics -- it just freed its ruling class from central regulation. (25/25)",

It uses its own sperm to self-fertilize its own eggs, which it then lays to produce new hermaphroditic offspring.\n\nAbout 1 in every 200 worms develops male instead. https://t.co/pJ8h7TGJN8 The male C. elegans is smaller, has a differently-shaped tail, and produces only sperm. It probes around the hermaphrodite vulval region with its tail, inserts its sperm, and thereafter, the hermaphrodite will then preferentially use the male's sperm rather than its own. The rate at which males appear in the population is heavily determined by the environment. When resources are scarce, a hermaphrodite will lay more XO (male) eggs. This points to the evolutionary role of sexual reproduction as a tool for adapting to environmental stress. There are a million more examples of the weird and wild diversity of sex in both the plant and animal kingdoms that I could list off the top of my head. I just wanted to highlight C. elegans because they are strange and cool (and one of the most commonly used model organisms)!

It is revolutionary, intentional, rigorous, scientific, ruthless, uncompromising, bloody.\n\n\"Socialism\" is a vibe. Malleable. Facile. https://t.co/cihlsdP3nR Before communism, \"socialism\" was the name for all the petty dreamers. The idealists, who wished upon a star for a society that was nicer to its downtrodden. To be a socialist requires little more than to personally adopt the values of kindness, fairness, and generosity. It was always easy for the elites to be socialists. They could afford to while away their days writing pamphlets and poems of an ideal world, free from the sins of greed and violence. They could imagine a world where they still lived in luxury, but no one suffered for it. When communism began to cohere as an ideology -- as the *real* movement to abolish the present state of things -- that utopianism started to fall out of fashion. This was no longer a philosophical exercise to explore what a \"perfect society\" would look like. It was now a war. \"Socialist\" then became the title adopted by those who did not believe in fighting a literal revolutionary war. They were the ones who wanted society to evolve, not to be destroyed and replaced. \"Socialism\" became even more vague -- it just meant \"a good society.\" The \"goodness\" of that society was completely subjective, and could now be mapped onto ANY ideology. Hitler was now free to call his movement \"socialist,\" because it worked toward the \"common weal\" -- that is, the weal of the Volksgemeinschaft, to the detriment of \"lesser\" folk. Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, even that vague promise of \"working toward the common good\" was demonized throughout the west as being too reminiscent of the real movement -- of communism. To even hold those ideals of peace and equality was treasonous. This allowed the anticommunist socialists to feel, without needing to actually present a material threat to the state, that they were repressed martyrs, stalwart heroes of the masses. To simply espouse socialist values became \"radical.\"\n\nSalvation through faith alone was back. And where are we today, in the 21st century? \"Socialism\" is no longer a dirty word. The banner is now once again held up proudly by those idealists who simply want a \"just and equitable society,\" who want fair wages and generous social programs and an end to war. The rightmost factions still try to paint socialism as an existential threat to the social order, and the left flank is eager to play up how \"radical\" they are for \"challenging the status quo,\" even as they march in lockstep with hegemony. To be socialist requires no sacrifice, no criticism of empire and oppression. It doesn't even require real opposition to genocide. A socialist is someone who wishes the world was a better place, but despises those who fight to end the status quo.\n\nA communist fights.",

People are learning to shake off the hegemonic narrative around Palestine and instinctively distrust the omnipresent propaganda telling them \"Israel\" is a bastion of democracy, is doing its best in a tough situation, or even that it \"has a right to exist\" at all. They understand the way motifs of \"barbarous rape\" and \"poor innocent hostages\" and \"civilian casualties\" and \"existential threat to the Jewish people\" are leveraged to subvert their tendency toward empathy and channel it toward the blatant oppression of a century-long occupation And yet they somehow fail to recognize that same pattern and apply that same scrutiny to the omnipresent \"anti-authoritarian\" propaganda against China, the DPRK, Russia, etc. They recognize \"Israel\" as a servant of US imperialism, but still detest all opponents to that hegemony. Even when Ukraine and the World Uyghur Congress reflexively issue statements of support for \"Israel,\" they still see them as the underdog. They reject \"Israel needs US support because it's under attack,\" but accept \"Xinjiang needs US support because China is committing genocide.\" They correctly understand that the billions of dollars provided by the US is both the main source of fuel for the genocide and an economic investment the empire makes as the cost of doing business. And yet they fail to apply that analysis to the tens of billions sent to Ukraine. They think the US got it wrong on Palestine, but happens to be on the right side of history when it comes to Ukraine. They think the narrative is completely ludicrous when it comes to Palestine, but believe them that the DPRK forces its citizens to live as prisoners. They watch in real time what true oppression looks like, and gaze in admiration of the heroic resistance to it, but believe 1.4 billion people live their lives too afraid to rebel against a totalitarian communist regime in China, or even voice mild critique of their government. They extrapolate this credulity into the past, gulping down myths of a \"dual genocide\" perpetrated by the USSR, believing once again that a people that fought tooth and nail to end a brutally repressive empire would then immediately roll over to a repressive \"Stalinist\" regime. I'd like to believe that the omnipresent web of lies, crafting a version of history so divorced from the truth is starting to buckle under the pressure of reality, observable in real time. I'd like to believe that people are learning that they have been lied to about everything. All that's happening is that people are becoming *open* to that possibility. Only a small fraction ever investigate further, unprompted.\n\nBut every single supporter of Palestine *can* learn to deconstruct the all-encompassing lies. They just need something real to tether them. This isn't to disparage the goodwill or intelligence or revolutionary potential of these people. Hegemony holds unbelievable sway over its subjects. It hides itself so expertly that questioning the story it presents requires first recognizing its existence and purpose. We all swim in the ocean of hegemony. People need to first learn about the existence of water before they can study the motion of the currents.\n\nThis is why study is central to communist organizing. We can never hope to succeed in our actions if we can't even identify our enemy.",

        "smushed_text": "\"How does the risk of long COVID differ from the myriad other risks humans tacitly accept?\" I think this is a very important question, so here's my attempt to explain the scale of risk:\n\nThe main differences are the transmissibility, novelty, magnitude, and commonality of risk. Transmissibility:\n\nPretty self-explanatory. You can't transmit Lyme disease or a horse riding injury to someone else, and you certainly can't *accidentally* do so simply by breathing on them. You might be willing to accept the health risks of smoking, but even though secondhand smoke can harm other people, you can't really transmit a smoking addiction to someone that way -- and *still* society has decided it's not ok to smoke indoors in public places, where others are exposed to a risk *you* took on for yourself. Novelty and magnitude:\n\nThese are related, and deal with the specific nature of the condition itself: the potential bad outcome at the other end of the risk. We don't yet know everything about long COVID, but what we do know is terrifying. It can affect pretty much every organ system, lasts for *at least* as long as we've been tracking it, and has a wide range of symptoms with varying degrees of impact from \"a mild, but persistent cough\" to \"cannot move or get out of bed, even to eat or drink.\" We don't know what risk factors are involved, we don't know the disease progression, we don't know the extent of the damage done with each subsequent infection, etc. ... The clues we have from clinical, cellular, and biochemical studies point to it being a very serious, chronic condition in a significant number of cases, with an accumulating risk of disease severity with each infection. Is it progressive? Recurrent? Static? Any of the above? Do people recover on their own eventually? How common is that? Is there potential for treatment or cure that is so effective it can completely mitigate the public health impact? These are questions we simply do not know, because the disease had existed for less than 4 years. Commonality:The risk of achieving the undesired outcome of a given risk calculation is cumulative with every time you roll the dice. Right now, COVID is running rampant, with no real surveillance: people barely even consider the *possibility* that they might have COVID. Many aren't testing at all, or they just take a single, unreliable antigen test and think a negative result absolves them. Governments and PH agencies are increasingly not requiring hospitals to test or report COVID numbers, and have shuttered other surveillance programs So we are dealing with a fog of war scenario, where the risk is completely unpredictable. But before that fog of war descended, COVID had already swept across the world in multiple overlapping waves, each able to burst through the supposed \"wall of immunity.\" It has integrated itself firmly in the global population, and has unchecked growth and unlimited evolutionary space to evade immunity indefinitely. COVID is everywhere. Almost a billion confirmed cases so far, with an unknowable number more that have gone undetected. The chance of never getting infected with COVID if you take no precautions is practically 0. The chance of getting high-impact long COVID once you get infected is another unknown, but even with estimates of 10%, we're talking potentially hundreds of millions of cases already. People are developing long COVID at a much faster rate than they are seeing any recovery. The global disease burden is accelerating rapidly, and could come to quickly eclipse even heart disease -- although part of the disease manifestation *includes* cardiovascular effects. In summary, the risk of long COVID is massive. The sheer scale of impact, the ease of invisibly transferring that risk to others, and the massive prevalence of the disease all make it undoubtedly the MOST impactful risk on a social level. There are plenty of things you personally could do that are more risky *on the individual level,* like wrestling bears or getting blackout drunk every night. But the highest risk things people do, they rarely choose to do. On the scale of society, these are blips compared to the risk presented by just going through \"normal life\" during the omnipresent spread of a debilitating virus. The scale of danger to society presented by COVID remains high, and every new study confirms that.",

When I was a kid, my Jewish school taught us about the Holocaust every year. We often had Holocaust survivors come speak to us about their experiences, to give us the human perspective. It was chilling to hear the horrors we had learned about in books come out of someone's mouth. In the eighth grade, my class took part in a project called Shalshelet, or \"Chain.\" We put together a documentary, interviewing survivors to create a \"chain of testimony,\" where we would carry their firsthand experience with us. We were told Holocaust denial would thrive as the generation of victims died out. That it was our duty to keep the chain going, so that no one could claim we were exaggerating. So that we could ask as bulwarks against it happening again. Where is the chain of testimony for the Nakba? The Zionists are attempting to break that chain right now. Before our eyes, they slaughter the last generation that lived through it. But Israel itself is the testimony. As long as it exists, everyone can see the Nakba firsthand.",

What is clear is that Zionist forces are doing their best to prevent settlers from abandoning their post as sentries in the occupation.\n\nhttps://t.co/H3JO8i7a0w Even the most \"pro-Palestinian\" voices seem to repeating the line that \"The Israeli government is directly responsible for provoking this violence through their own violence.\" This is inaccurate. The deaths of the settlers is not simply a violent \"reaction\" to abuses. It is the deliberate strategy of the Zionist project to lure settlers to the land with deep propaganda and economic incentives, station them as \"civilian\" defenders of the occupation, and then act horrified that resistance involves \"civilian\" casualties. These are not mere civilians: they are as much pawns of the Zionist regime as are soldiers and police. And my heart does weep for those who have been so thoroughly indoctrinated as to believe their ultimate purpose in life is to be a human shield for the occupation. I have no sympathy for the many settlers that chose to move to Israel *in response* to the resistance, those who have taken up the cause as a holy war, who form gangs and commit pogroms against the Palestinian civilians in service of the fascist cause. I do have some sympathy for those who have realized that Zionism is done for, want to flee, but are now trapped by the very regime that recruited them. It shouldn't take a direct threat to their lives to abandon oppression, but regardless, all that matters is that they are gone. But Zionism cannot survive if it allows these \"civilian\" sentinels to flee. They are the entire bedrock of the occupation. And if they have to be trapped by force, that is exactly what the fascist state will do. This is what happens when you get in bed with fascists.",

        "smushed_text": "Back when I was an underdeveloped communist-in-name-only, the most dispiriting thing holding me back mentally was the nagging question of \"Why has NOTHING in the past century been able to defeat the capitalist regime? Why is no one even trying? Are we just doomed from the start?\" https://t.co/BkIVphmGgo The answer, of course, is that every attempt at an \"American communist movement\" has failed *because* of their failure on national liberation. The closest anyone has gotten to building a revolution in the imperial core has been various attempted national liberation movements. There will never be a communist movement that has room for \"Americans,\" because the purpose of the revolution is to abolish the American empire in its entirety. There will be no more \"first world proletarians\" and there will be no more \"Americans.\" That identity will be obviated. It is absolutely necessary for any developing revolutionary to reckon with that fact before they can develop any farther than \"left-of-Democrats.\" It was this realization that brought me the *most* optimism, because I was no longer anticipating fighting a losing battle. Once I stopped being \"an American communist\" and started being \"a communist,\" the path forward finally became clear.\n\nAnd I'm not an exception among my \"first world proletarian\" peers. I've personally guided many people to that same conclusion, and obviously MY influence is tiny. National liberation is the key to revolution. It always has been. And it's growing stronger all the time -- not just on the periphery of the empire, but among its various internal colonies and oppressed peoples. As fascism continues to encroach on various subsections of self-identified Americans, they find themselves pulled away from liberal \"acceptance\" and \"representation\" and facile \"rights,\" and toward revolutionary liberation. If a group of novice radicals in white-as-fuck middle-of-nowhere Kansas can read Blood in My Eye and find it energizing and deepen their revolutionary resolve, they can do it here in Baltimore. They can do it in Atlanta, they can do it in Pine Ridge, they can do it in Hawaii. Facing down our material realities and our social obstacles is not dispiriting. It's clarifying. Only through clarity can we begin to conceive of our eventual victory.",

At that level, infection seems entirely possible. https://t.co/VaXrsvPADV 2. What epidemiological surveillance is employed to track the incidence of cryptosporidiosis? Have healthcare facilities in the region been given testing and reporting guidelines? Is there active monitoring of the public health situation, used to inform ongoing policy decisions? 3. Why is the public health guidance being presented in such a way as to suggest that \"healthy\" individuals don't need to worry, when even a \"mild\" case of cryptosporidiosis causes painful and disruptive gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, lasting for weeks? 4. What treatment protocols are used in the city's wastewater system, and is treated water recycled into the drinking supply? Given the difficulty of cryptosporidium decontamination via chlorination, and the presence of infectious cysts in feces, recycling may be hazardous. 5. In light of both this and last year's contamination incident, which itself lead to a boil water advisory, what steps are being taken to prevent future contamination in our water supply, and why have they not been implemented in the last year? 6. Considering the demonstrable fragility of our water system, why is testing and reporting not conducted on a more consistent and comprehensive basis? Why are residents expected to consistently peruse government websites to have a chance of discovering emerging health hazards?",

Don't just READ about the intersection of housing and settler colonialism: help fight back! Systemic resistance is being built as we speak. This isn't just \"liberal charity,\" it's one small aspect of materially shifting the landscape.\n\nhttps://t.co/pEzG2exAED Upfront requirements are astonishing: down payment, real estate agent fee, title, insurance, title insurance (they have to be making this shit up \ud83d\ude44), inspection, earnest money, furnishing, repairs, and of course \"creditworthiness,\" which is explicitly \"usefulness to capital.\" Homeownership generates equity for yourself, instead of running yet another treadmill of constant survival costs that get used up and need to be replenished through wage labor. It materially vests a subset of the working class into the general wellbeing of the capitalist system. Through myriad pathways, homeownership acts as one of the primary vectors for reinforcing bourgeois hegemony, both on a material basis and a superstructural one. It filters out those deemed too destabilizing to assimilate into the ranks of this imperialist settler garrison. Nevertheless, this paradigm is collapsing. The metrics for filtering and the mechanisms for reinforcing are both failing to reconcile the steadily degrading economic base they are designed to defend. The garrison is under assault, and the illusion of invulnerability is fading. Obviously, this doesn't mean the empire, the settler colonial enterprise, or capitalism itself is \"done for.\" This is simply a crack in the phalanx's defenses, one that can only be widened through deliberate, coordinated assault. As of right now, we don't have that. Given leeway, capitalism has always found ways to innovate patches for its cracks. For over a century, the \"Western Left\" has given it that leeway. An endless cycle of failing to take advantage of the cracks, replaced with eagerness to economize and integrate into that garrison. The settler mindset has so thoroughly pervaded the broad current of so-called \"Marxists,\" who can scarcely even begin imagining the real forces governing the property relations they \"oppose.\" Instead, they take as given that their purpose is to take ownership of the garrison. This is the primary reason the west as a whole has continued its extractive, exploitative, genocidal, ecocidal project largely unabated for so long. The unshakeable lure of a facile \"liberated settler colonialism\" has held back the revolutionary potential of the mass of settlers.",

Which was kind of the entire point. I wasn't issuing praise or denunciation, and I certainly wasn't writing some grand treatise -- such a thing would be laughable at this stage of MUG's development.

Learning. \ud83d\ude4f https://t.co/mLd0OtXOEf Science is not about performing experiments in a lab. The core of science is a very simple, intuitive cycle: using observations to form testable hypotheses, and using those hypotheses to guide further observations. Experimentation is one way of getting those observations: it's good for *conditional* observation, i.e. creating very specific conditions to constrain the expected observations to a range of possibilities, with the ability to modify those conditions and observe what changes. But there are other observational methods at our disposal. Analytical observation relies on taking existing data and using new analytical methods to construct new theoretical models. One example of this is meta-analyses, which present a fuller picture than individual studies. And of course, we have in situ observation, which takes place at the site of the naturally occurring phenomenon. This is done in cases where lab conditions can't accurately reflect natural ones, where collecting samples would be impossible, or where testing would be unethical. Social science, astrophysics, ecology, archaeology, and more all rely heavily on this latter type of observation. You can still use these observations to form testable hypotheses: it's just that the test comes in the form of *more* in situ observation, and more granular data. Marxism relies on empirical assessment to build testable hypotheses. One example is the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, a theory which has been borne out in the real world. Another is the tendency of oppressed peoples to create revolution to alter their class position.",

Same with every other social relation that doesn't perfectly conform to hegemony. You can be polyamorous and reactionary, you can be monogamous and revolutionary. In fact, wherever possible, modern liberal hegemony often prefers to *assimilate* nonconformity, rather than repress it.

I believe you care about them; you (probably) want to help, to create better circumstances for them.

The concept that they would be *leaders* in the movement is laughable to you, although you would deny it. How do I know this? Because if you truly believed there was any revolutionary potential to be found in the precariat AND you truly held this notion of \"eschew wealth and live like the masses,\" you would not be employed. You'd deliberately try to be in a position of scraping by. And if you actually did that, you would be rightfully scorned by those same masses. They would see right through your cosplay. They would treat you like a bourgeois poverty fetishist, wealthy and entitled enough to *choose* to throw away the very stability they wish they had. Far better for someone with wealth to recognize their class position and use everything they have to build the movement, rather than discard it in some ritualistic purification rite. If I was handed a million dollars, I could think of a million ways to use it for the movement. (Side note: to anyone in that vaunted status of being both petty bourgeois/labor aristocrat AND wannabe revolutionary, hit me up. I've got plenty of ideas for how to use that money besides throwing it away.) Anyway, stop being a LARPer. Live in the real world.

For a worker, homeownership represents a crystallization of a massive amount of one's expended labor power (sifted through capital-owned production and a fraction repaid as wages) into a static means of survival that requires much less reinvestment of labor-equivalent than rent. Rather than, for example, dedicating 80 hours per month toward earning enough for rent, you begin needing to dedicate only 10 hours per month toward interest, taxes, and repairs. Eventually, the loan is paid, and the upkeep costs in labor fall even more. Depending on the price of the house, interest rate, wages, etc. you might invest tens of thousands of hours into solidifying a \"permanent\" solution to the most significant survival need \u2013 one which is deeply regimented by capital. The capitalist state is set up specifically to affirm the security of property rights, and by becoming a homeowner, you now become a beneficiary of that system of control \u2013 but only to the extent that it remains that control. This is the main reason even buying a home just for your own personal use gives you a material interest in the stability of the capitalist system. It makes it so a tiny portion of the state apparatus is now dedicated to enshrining that ownership \"in perpetuity.\" If your home is destroyed by a natural disaster, capital will remit its value in the form of insurance. If you want to move somewhere else, capital assures you that you can exchange it. If revolutionaries threaten to seize it, capital will violently defend it. And so on. The more deeply you internalize a sense of the immutability of the capitalist system, the more you are \"allowed\" to believe even this singular holding of yours is truly permanent.

They have absolutely no desire to entreat the media to help them spin a \"narrative\" so they can \"change hearts and minds.\" They are trying to directly make it impossible for universities to conduct business. The reason the media wants to talk to participants instead of \"official spokespeople\" is the exact reason the movement refuses to give them that. The media is an arm of political power, the lens through which capital's interests are refracted and focused onto the masses. The power of the media comes from its usefulness to capital, and to survive, it must serve that same power structure that also creates the very genocide these students are fighting. They recognize that there is no pleading with a system that is doing what it's designed for. Why talk to participants? Because not everyone is good on camera. When journalists come calling, they are betting on the stress of being seen, the plays toward ego, etc. causing individuals to slip up. They want untrained, passionate activists saying things that they can use. Saying something that can be taken out of context, something that can be twisted to paint the entire movement as uninformed, rambling, chaotic, hypocritical, heinous, dangerous. Anyone can make these mistakes when they're inexperienced in media relations and unprepared to speak. Imagine being dragged out onto a stage in front of thousands of people and being told to give an impromptu lecture on any given subject, even something you know pretty well! You might know it well enough to improvise a lecture, but you'll almost certainly stammer or flub a word. You might state something as fact that is simply not true -- which you KNOW is not true, and that you would never say, given the time to prepare. But the stress of being thrust into this position, of having all those judging eyes on you, makes your brain clumsy. The students are far too disciplined to fall for these feeble tricks. They don't have anything to gain from letting predatory journalists run rampant. By keeping a tight lid on media contact, they both preempt deliberate distortions and present a unified front. The people who want to know what's going on -- the potential supporters, the people who might be inspired to take action themselves -- get their information directly from the movement leaders. Not the press.",

And it's not just people who have a disability. It's also elder care, emergency services, transport, food, communication, education, etc. These are all forms of infrastructure, which shouldn't be handled on an individual level, because many people can't easily do these things. And you may say \"Oh, that can be handled on a community level!\"\n\nBut picture this: a community in an area prone to drought is now left at a disadvantage, because they need to invest more into water management. How about a community with a higher rate of disabilities? There are a million structural issues that face societies. Some can be solved easily by communities. Some are harder, but manageable. Some are impossible.\n\nIn these harder situations, communities with greater needs should not be left to fend for themselves. The goal of properly-constructed states should be to address inequities. Not just the inequities imposed by the societies previously in power, but also natural inequities: geography, demographics, natural disasters, bad luck, mistakes, and more. Hierarchies are not inherently evil. When used improperly, as they often are, they involve the confiscation of the resources of the many to serve the few. But when done correctly, they are necessary for rallying mass amounts of surplus resources for the benefit of everyone.",

The best way to describe it is less \"tired\" and more the feeling you get when your body is actively fighting off an infection. I'm not sleepy; my immune system is trying to stop me from using energy, so it can \"fight.\" Exercise makes it worse, since that just uses up the smaller budget of energy my body has allocated for non-immune system functions at any given time.\n\nSame with thinking; brains use a LOT of energy. My ability to concentrate or make plans is shot during these periods. None of this happened before I got COVID. Now it happens every few weeks. I haven't seen a doctor to confirm my suspicions, because honestly... I don't trust clinicians. The practice is far behind the science in this field, and has been for a long time. With COVID adding yet another trigger for chronic fatigue -- one that is ultra-common compared to older diseases -- combined with the pathological desire to ignore the ongoing pandemic, clinicians have fallen even farther behind the body of scientific literature on the subject. I don't really have the money or the energy to waste running around, trying to find a doctor who won't just try to gaslight me, psychologize my condition, or say \"I have no idea how to treat this.\"\n\nBecause the truth is, I don't know how to treat it either. No one does. I'll probably seek an official diagnosis at some point. It would be useful to have documentation I can point to if necessary. But I would need a doctor I can actually trust, and this pandemic especially has been absolutely terrible for the prospect of trusting the medical system.",

The Bolsheviks were legendary for their refusal to cede ground to even the Mensheviks -- whose platform of \"we need to work with our enemies\" was an utter failure. https://t.co/GiooRpXnFA You could have gone with Mao, who worked with the KMT, first to defeat the warlords, and then later to beat back the imperial invaders. Or Stalin, who did the same with the western powers to defeat the Nazis. I wonder why you don't see those two as Good Examplars of Compromise \ud83e\udd14 Does it have anything to do with their \"authoritarian\" reputations, refusing to dilute their principles in the name of \"unity\"? Do you maybe hate Stalin and Mao more than you hate reactionaries, and only cite \"leftist heroes\" as long as you can contort them to your own project? Could it possibly be that your urge to compromise and collaborate is only applied in one direction, and you only exhort people to \"work with\" the most regressive tendencies, but abhor anyone holding revolutionary politics? I call this \"lobster trap unity.\" You are called upon to crawl to the right, through a narrow tunnel, to reach an imagined \"broad coalition\" a bait you can smell just out view. If you still find yourself outside that coalition, you just have to keep crawling until you find it. If you bothered to look behind you as you crawled, you'd notice that the walls of the tunnel are covered in spikes pointed inward, preventing you from backtracking. And when at last you land in the middle of the trap, you'll find that the tunnel entrance can no longer be reached. Our job as communists -- not \"leftists,\" never that vague embrace of \"not as far right as we could be\" -- is to bring people to *us*. We don't hide who we are and we don't compromise on our principles to win popularity contests, even rhetorically. Ours is the ideology of liberation, plain and simple. Trans liberation is just as central to our mission as indigenous liberation, black liberation, women's liberation, and the liberation of ALL oppressed peoples and classes. We win by standing by those principles at all times. We have absolutely no room in *our* movement for anyone who sees that as a dealbreaker, and no need to contort ourselves to fit *their* movement. The majority being against us is a facile construct from the context we are currently in, not an inmate feature of \"the masses.\" Unite all that can be united. That is the only basis for a liberation movement. We have very few true enemies among the people -- and when we stand firm, those rare few will recuse *themselves* from unifying with us.",

Instead, it must rely on idealist abstractions, like \"liberty.\" https://t.co/qYihcKywNM In questions like \"freedom to sell your organs,\" we can see clearly the true horror of these liberal ideals. An argument barely even needs to be made to explain the absurdity of presenting \"willingly\" harvesting your own body to sell on the market as \"freedom.\" Anyone who has not had their senses of empathy and self-preservation surgically removed by the knife of liberalism can instantly feel the visceral repulsion at this prospect. Freedom to be dismembered. Freedom to serve. Freedom to shiver and starve, alone and abandoned. These are the \"freedoms\" offered to us by liberalism.\n\nCentral to all liberal conceptions of \"rights\" is the right of property, and for those who own no property, their rights begin and end at the right to turn their bodies into a commodity. You have the freedom to sell this commodity, piecemeal, however you like: sell your labor power; sell your organs; sell your womb; sell sexual access; sell your entire life to die in the service of empire.\n\nCapitalism drives liberal society to commodify every particle of life. Your rights only extend to this depraved access to the market, which seeks only to butcher you into appetizing cuts of meat. What freedom! The freedom of abject slavery.\n\nNever ask what freedoms liberalism must subjugate to guarantee your right to exploitation. Freedom to live. Freedom to eat. Freedom to be healthy. Freedom to learn and grow and build. Liberalism doesn't care about these *communal* freedoms. The freedom of capital to bulldoze forests and tear down existing communities is above the freedom of those communities to exist. The freedom of an individual to breathe clean air is subservient to the freedom of the factory to belch toxic smoke. The freedom of a parent to \"raise children however they want\" takes precedence over a child to not be abused.\n\nAnd \"bodily autonomy\"? There is no such thing. You may be granted the \"freedom\" to sell your organs, but not the freedom to never have to even consider that \"option.\" You have the freedom to not get vaccinated against deadly infectious diseases, but not the freedom *from* those diseases. A right to \"bodily autonomy\" is impossible under capitalism, where the needs of your body must be gated behind the control of capital to maintain property relations. If you were guaranteed these rights, you could not be compelled to work for wages to access them. Communism promises you one thing: that you have the right to all the gains of society, simply for being a part of it. No need to sell yourself to capital to purchase these rights. You have the right to live, to fill your belly, to be healthy, to thrive, to keep ALL your organs.",

The key is whether or not they're willing to engage with investigating WHY things are bad, and what to do about it. Talking with most people is smooth sailing, because we can bond over these issues and find a common ground for how to think about them. But with the \"leftists,\" it's like pulling teeth. They think they've done all the investigation, and have come to all the wrong conclusions. In fact, it almost feels like the *closer* these people are to my own thought process, the *more* annoying it is to talk with them if we diverge on specific concepts that should be a given -- until they get close *enough* to where we can have an honest discourse over the nuances.",

There is not a single law that was designed as a magnanimous gesture. The corpus of law has exactly one purpose: the maintenance of bourgeois rule. Specific legal victories can be won through concerted effort by oppressed people; these are concessions, tactical retreats by the ruling class, not changes in the fundamental character of their law. They are not freely given, and they are temporary. And they remind us of this every day, with constant warnings that they could (and often do) roll back any legally granted \"protections.\"\n\nWe need to be clear-eyed in our recognition that the bourgeois state is fundamentally opposed to liberation of all types. Changing the law is not a viable path to permanent liberation. Preserving the law is running on a treadmill. Capitalists have complete control of every state apparatus, and at every opportunity, they will revoke any legal gains we make. Do not become addicted to legal victory.",

I would hope revolutionaries don't need convincing that those numbers alone do not suddenly make the Democrats a viable avenue for \"converting\" people to the cause of revolution.

They exist in a social context.\n\nhttps://t.co/WAjtcvsFfu That context is complex and dynamic. People move in various political directions throughout their lives, but overwhelmingly, the political force driving most people's movement under bourgeois hegemony is liberalism. This force is applied both passively and actively. \"Passively\" in the form of acculturation with other liberals. \"Actively\" in the form of political spaces explicitly constructed to regiment its constituents deeper into liberal ideology. These protests, much like the DNC, are very much the latter. It's often easy to mistake explicitly liberal environments as being \"open\" and \"disorganized,\" to view those who find themselves in these spaces as shopping around for a more \"coherent\" ideology. It's easy to mistake political energy for \"radicalism.\" But liberalism is not weak. Liberalism bares its teeth when revolutionaries try to work our way into the lion's den. Challenges to the liberal status quo are met with immediate backlash. \"Free and open debate\" stops at the first whiff of \"authoritarian\" notions. Our ideas are not welcome in liberal spaces. Entryism has never worked in its long history of fruitless attempts. The dominant ideology holds preeminence in the considerations made by even the most \"open-minded\" people, and can only be counteracted in spaces designed *for* radicalization. Not spaces designed against it.",

        "smushed_text": "The optical illusion of \"evolving to become mild\" has come about largely because of omicron's innate ability to evade immunity while having a relatively lower fatality rate. This was always a coincidence. It was not a case of transmissibility winning out over lethality. Omicron emerged in an evolutionary landscape filled with people who had already been infected and/or vaccinated, and millions of human incubators packed with viruses containing a wide range of genetic variation. Any variation that enhanced transmission was being selected for. The primary roadblock to infection was widespread (partial) immunity. COVID messes with your immune system, turns your T cells against you, but humoral immunity (the antibodies that circulate for a time following exposure) has a protective effect against infection. In this context, the primary way to enhance transmissibility is the ability to evade antibodies to the predominant viral strains. This is really easy to do, since a virus being different in *any way* makes it unrecognizable to those antibodies. The only caveat, of course, is that variations that also happen to make the virus worse at infection (e.g. worse at binding to cells) will obviously be selected *against*. Omicron passed the test by being distinct from ancestral strains and NOT having its infectiousness hampered. The reason I call this an optical illusion is that it only *looks* like transmissibility came at the cost of lower CFR because omicron happened to kill less quickly than delta or the original strain. It didn't have to be that way. CFR wasn't being selected *against*. In fact, part of the way COVID is able to be so successful at spreading is the same reason it kills AND causes long COVID. It has a number of traits that allow it to suppress your immune response, infiltrate deep into your body, and turn your body into a viral production factory. Variations that enhance its ability to -- for example -- suppress interferon, make infection both more dangerous AND more transmissible. Omicron didn't need to be more dangerous if it could just be more immune evasive by being unrecognizable. We have seen a swarm of lineages emerge from that success -- variants that are distinct from ancestral omicron (immune evasive) and simultaneously more deadly. They haven't been quite as omnipresent as omicron, since they aren't working in the same evolutionary landscape. But don't be surprised when the right combination of naturally-occurring variations happens to line up to give us another, even more deadly omicron level event -- this time, unleashed on a population that isn't even paying attention.",

They intentionally maintain vagueness around this, because it is necessarily an open-ended operation: resistance to oppression never goes away. However, in pursuit of this impossible goal, they do have some specific goals:\n\n- The death or imprisonment of every member of *every* militant organization in the resistance (not just Hamas). This includes hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom are currently in exile. - The destruction of all social infrastructure (schools, hospitals, power plants, etc.) in Gaza that is not under the direct control of the occupation. This has been a major priority of the genocidal campaign, and the major reason they are specifically naming their enemy \"Hamas\" Hamas is the governing entity of Gaza, and has administered most social infrastructure for decades. The indiscriminate bombing of hospitals and universities and refugee camps under the banner of \"driving out Hamas\" has always been the central aim of the campaign. - The pacification of the entire axis of resistance, across several sovereign states. This is their \"reach goal,\" because it would almost certainly require the US to either invade or enforce an embargo on Iran (or else engineer one of the most unlikely coups in history). Long story short, there is no horizon too distant for \"Israel\" in its pursuit of unchallenged hegemony over Palestine. For the US, this is a problem, because the maintenance costs of its Middle Eastern colony are very quickly overtaking the benefits. All the US can think to do is continue to shovel resources at the problem, hoping to stave off collapse. But they're not foolish enough to believe that's sustainable. The plan for right now is to destroy as much of the resistance as possible, to hopefully stall for a bit longer.",

Same if you -- like 75% of American households -- own $30,000 more than you owe. When these people say \"paycheck to paycheck,\" they don't mean they'll be on the streets. They mean they might have to liquidate assets. They might have to hit pause on the wealth generation machine that 90% of the world can't even access in the first place. And \"might have to\" is doing a lot of work there, considering that most of them have enough in *liquid assets* to pay their bills for three months (so really \"paycheck to 6 paychecks\"). Three months to find a new job before you even have to start liquidating your $200k net worth. This classic formulation of \"the government is giving so much money away to other countries instead of helping poor starving Americans\" is an attempt to present Americans -- the richest population on the planet -- as the primary victim of American imperialism. $3.8 billion a year is pocket change to the US. It's 0.0025% of the ~$155 trillion owned by the top 65%. There is no burden being placed on the country or its people for funding genocide, and it's disgusting to present it as even close to the scale of Palestinian suffering. The genocide is being perpetrated in your name. The government is not redirecting that pocket change away from your American Dream House -- it's setting aside a few bucks per person to ensure it can extract blood from its imperial subjects. Blood you use to fertilize your lawn. People are being slaughtered by the thousands, and your concern is that the government owes you $11. \n\nAnd you wonder why actual communists despise you.",

The gating of the means of survival is a structural necessity of the capitalist system, meaning housing cannot ever be freely distributed if capitalism is to survive. https://t.co/NgNG2OCZrk In a capitalist society, the state works to advance the interests of capital itself, and in the arena of housing, that means calibrating access in whatever way it determines to benefit capital the most. Sometimes this DOES mean building some public housing, but never enough. The role of social welfare programs in the capitalist system is to manage the \"dregs\" that the system naturally produces, rather than allow a latent oppositional class to grow and fester. This class presents a number of threats to the state's stability. The most obvious is that this class of dispossessed, desperate individuals -- seeking out ways to survive and with no particular allegiance to bourgeois laws and norms -- set up criminal enterprises and informal economies that threaten the sanctity of bourgeois hegemony. Marxists will often overemphasize the counter-revolutionary aspect of the state's involvement in managing the lumpen masses (\"they're afraid of us getting organized!\"), but this is generally a subordinate priority. Revolution is rare, \"crime\" is omnipresent. All this to say, one of the many ways the state has of maintaining its grip is to allow some trickle of access to the means of survival that don't involve oppressed classes seizing it from outside the system and building anything oppositional. But that must be dosed carefully. The state cannot EVER provide enough housing to \"fix the housing crisis,\" because it's not a crisis: it's the normal functioning of capital. Survival can never be guaranteed, otherwise production on behalf of the capitalists cannot be compelled in exchange for survival. The state will only ever build enough public housing to maintain a baseline capable of helping manage the most precarious. This practice was only ever a supplement to other means of enforcement, such as policing, and the state is much more amenable to the more overt repression.",

Endemic does not mean cases go down. Endemic does not mean \"no longer a concern.\" Endemic means persistent in a population. It is a LONG-term assessment. It means that we don't see new variants from different lineages emerge and sweep across the globe, but rather isolated outbreaks that emerge from a low-level background of cases from the *same* lineage. Omicron is not descended from delta, delta did not descend from beta, beta did not descend from alpha. All of these are competing, distinct lineages. That's not something you see in endemic diseases like influenza, where each outbreak is a descendant of the last successful one. This is important because it means we still don't actually know where the next variant will come from or what it will look like. All we know is that it necessarily must be able to evade immunity to omicron. Considering that we're seeing evidence of reinfection with the same strain within a relatively short time span, that *could* mean the next threat is a sublineage of omicron, OR a sublineage of any prior variant of concern, OR another new and distinct lineage. Bottom line, we can't make the determination that COVID is endemic until we see that outbreaks are no longer coming from distinct lineages. And if we ever do, that's not actually good news, because it means same-strain reinfection is normal, which means deaths will keep coming. Also this, which covers more of what it actually looks like once it IS endemic:\n\nhttps://t.co/eAfGA63Uu8",

        "smushed_text": "If you're wondering why we use the colorful phrase \"social-democracy is the left wing of fascism,\" try to understand how ghoulish it is to see this through the lens of \"Americans will have to pay more for coffee.\"\n\nCoffee is one of the most egregious examples of unequal exchange. https://t.co/GUp0syjrhq In Colombia specifically, the vast majority of coffee pickers are migrant workers, largely from Venezuela. They make around 11-16 cents per kilo of raw cherries picked. This work is done at a grueling pace during harvest season, and then the work dries up when the season ends. These workers are highly precarious, work in dangerous conditions without PPE, and for their efforts, they are paid abysmally -- even during the limited period when they can work at all. Regulations like child labor laws, minimum wage, and maximum hours, are flagrantly ignored. (The above claims are supported by Sanne van der Wal et al., Working conditions of flower packers and coffee pickers in Colombia, SOMO, 2018) To get a kilo of roasted coffee beans, it takes about 5 kg of raw coffee cherries, for which the average coffee picker in Colombia is paid about 70 cents.\n\nDepending on the final preparation, you can expect to get about 120 cups of coffee from one kilo. In other words, out of the cost of your cup of coffee, about half a penny went to compensate the worker who harvested it.\n\nThere are many other steps in the production process to get from the ground to your cup, of course. The picker is not the only one who requires compensation. Planters are often a subset of the same population of workers who will harvest; the planting season is less labor-intensive, so most of the pickers are out of work during this time.\n\nAfter harvest, the raw fruit is dried, hulled, fermented, and generally roasted before export. All of these steps before shipping are done at tiny wages. Mere pennies from the total cost.\n\nColombia exports around 635 million kilos of coffee each year, generating around $4 billion in revenue: that's about $6.5/kilogram, easily 5-6 times the cost of all labor to that point. Coffee is being imported to the US at ~5.4 cents/cup, and from there, all downstream labor starts to get compensated at much higher rates. When you buy a cup of coffee at a shop, the worker who made it is still adding more value than they get paid for -- but not 5 times as much. And if tariffs cause the price of importing that coffee to jump to even *double* its current price, the change is largely negligible by the time it reaches the consumer. Because of the immense exploitation of third world producers, the cost of the raw material barely fluctuates. It's unfathomable to see this entire production chain, built on gross worker exploitation, brutal conditions, environmental destruction, and the utter pillaging of the third world, through the lens of \"My coffee might cost me the equivalent of an extra minute of labor.\" Trump isn't doing this to punish *you* the poor, American consumer. He's doing this to flex the ungodly economic might of the US empire. For less than a penny, some of the most precarious workers in the world slave away to get you that cup of coffee -- and even that is too much.",

        "smushed_text": "By 1932, following the consistent failure of the ruling liberal government coalition to address the needs of the people, both the fascists and the communists were in the midst of surging support. Incumbent president Paul Von Hindenburg barely eked out a victory... https://t.co/17NBx0YsxP ... largely due to support from social democrats seeking to avert the election of Hitler, but who absolutely despised the communists. Hindenburg tried to rule mainly by emergency decree, due to how fragmented the Reichstag was, but failed to achieve anything. He replaced Center Party chancellor Heinrich Br\u00fcning with an even more right-wing reactionary, Franz von Papen, as a bridge to bring the Nazis on board. This government was just as ineffective as the previous, prompting even more deal-making with the Nazis. The Nazis demanded new parliamentary elections, radio access, and a reverse on the ban of the SA and SS. Papen and Hindenburg acquiesced, dissolving the Reichstag and giving the Nazis room to run rampant with campaigning, street demonstrations, and mass political violence. In July 1932, the newly reinvigorated SA led a 7,000-man \"recruitment march\" through Antola, which strongly supported communists and social democrats. Protestors threw things at the Nazis, who proceeded to swarm into the crowd and beat them. Deadly conflict broke out... ... which Papen blamed on communists, and used as pretext to suspend the Prussian government.\n\nAt the end of July, the election showed even higher support for both the Nazis and the Communist Party. Yet again, the Nazis refused to work with the center without more concessions. Another election was scheduled for November.\n\nIn the interim, the Hindenburg-Papen government implemented a series of decrees meant to \"balance the budget,\" including lowering the minimum wage, means testing that tossed millions off unemployment, and tax cuts for businesses. Crackdowns on both communist and social democrat local governments and organizations ramped up, under the false claim that they were planning to merge. They weren't: the SPD despised the KPD so intensely that they worked with fascist paramilitaries to kill KPD leaders. The crackdowns on communists and the political mainstreaming of the Nazis did nothing to dissuade the steady rise of support for the communists. In the November election, the Nazis and the SPD lost several seats, while the KPD gained ground, even as overall turnout declined. Fearing an unstoppable communist ascent buoyed by flagging support for both the \"centrist\" and far-right parties, and totally opposed to any policies that would harm the capitalist class, the liberals made overtures to the \"left flank\" of the Nazi party, under Gregor Strasser. Hitler moved quickly to ostracize the Strasserists, and began negotiating with the recently replaced, but still influential Papen, to work on a new coalition.\n\nBy January, Papen, Hindenburg, Hitler, and a host of capitalists had come to a deal: Hitler would be chancellor. We all know what happened next.\n\nAt no point in that rapid ascent did Hitler or the Nazi party win an election on the backs of disaffected leftists refusing to vote for the \"lesser of two evils.\" Rather, every step of the way, liberals chose fascists over communists.",

In this case, we'll imagine an 8th grade teacher who gets infected outside of school. Maybe their spouse got it from work. Maybe they got it at a packed grocery. Either way, this teacher was fully vaccinated and always wears a mask, but still caught COVID anyway. Bad luck. The teacher got infected on Sunday evening, but doesn't realize yet.\n\nMonday through Thursday, they go to work, teaching 30 students per class, for a total of 120 students over the course of a day.\n\nOn Thursday, it's time for testing. 32 of the students did not opt in. On Friday, the teacher develops symptoms and stays home. None of the students have symptoms, and are still in school that day, even though 8 of them caught COVID from their teacher. By the end of the day, 2 more students have been infected. The results of the pooled test come in and there is a positive case. This means everyone in the pool is now supposed to receive an individual test. Since it's now Friday afternoon, this will have to happen on Monday. Over the weekend, the 10 infected (but asymptomatic) students spread the infection to 12 family members.\n\nOn Monday, 2 of the infected students stay home with symptoms. The other 8 return to school and participate in individual antigen testing. During lunch on Monday, 6 more students get infected, since everyone needs to take off their masks to eat.\n\nBy Monday evening, individual results come in. Because antigen tests are less sensitive, and they are asymptomatic, only 4 students test positive and are told to quarantine By Tuesday, there are 10 infected students, none of whom are even aware.\n\nBy Thursday, 2 more have developed symptoms and stayed home without testing. 12 more students have been infected. Time to test again! Results will come in tomorrow, by which point 2 more will be infected. By the time we've gone through 2 rounds of weekly testing, 40 students, 50 family members, and an unknown number of family members' coworkers have all been infected. And we will *still* have infected students coming in next Monday to continue the cycle.",

        "smushed_text": "OK, this is triggering my biochemistry brain, so I gotta weigh in.\n\nFirst of all, I want to get it out of the way: I am not against the concept of DIY HRT in and of itself, nor am I suggesting this person's methods are egregious. There are positive and negatives to highlight. https://t.co/VmJAeiuiw4 Starting with the positives:\n\nEnsuring everything is fully dissolved and filtered to minimize particulate matter (tiny, bits of solid stuff). Particulates can cause emboli, abscesses, inflammation, infections, and more, and this method is quite good at minimizing that. Various specific aspects of that process were also taken with proper care, such as heating in stages, agitating regularly, using a proper filter, priming it first to avoid loss, etc.\n\nSterilizing the final product is also crucial for obvious reasons. That segues nicely into the negatives.\n\nFirst is the fact that heat treating to kill off any microbes is not sufficient to ensure safety. There is still a risk of contamination with endotoxins, which normal sterilization does not degrade. Bacteria constantly shed endotoxins, and even once you kill them, the endotoxins remain capable of causing harm. It's one of the reasons you can't just cook spoiled food to kill off the bacteria and expect it to be safe for consumption. Getting rid of endotoxins is really difficult, which is why medications and medical equipment -- especially those destined for injection, where it can bypass many of your body's protections -- need controlled preparation. Testing for the presence of endotoxins is almost always done using a special substance derived from the blood of horseshoe crabs, which visibly reacts with the toxins. This is mandated by regulation for all medical supplies destined for the inside of a patient. The syringes, filters, and vials used in the video should be medical grade already, and have likely all been tested with this assay. I can't say anything about the bottle she's using to prepare the batch, or the oil, alcohol, or estrogen. As far as the choice of estrogen, it is unclear where it came from or what its full chemical specifications are, and she doesn't seem to know either. \"Estrogen enanthate, probably?\" doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the manufacturer. Estradiol enanthate itself definitely should be suitable for HRT, as it is a prodrug of estradiol, and is considered bioidentical to endogenous estradiol. It has been studied for use in feminizing HRT, and although is currently not prescribed, I see no real risk to its use. But without manufacturer data, I can't assess the product being used for things like purity, degradation, additives, etc. This is honestly the biggest source of risk in DIY -- it's the part you yourself *aren't* doing yourself. As far as other quibbles, I definitely would prefer she use gloves and a respirator and be more precise in measurements. The dosing here is unpredictable, because \"2 grams\" included a bunch of the powder not making it into the mixture, and \"100 mL\" was completely eyeballed. That said, there is a lot of flexibility in HRT dosage anyway, with not a lot of consequences for being a bit off. I would be very concerned if this was a medication with significant side effects, or whose immediate effectiveness is highly dose-dependent. For HRT, there's already such huge variation in outcomes and timelines due to internal biology that being slightly over or under dosed is not make or break. However, for consistency, it's still best practice to be very deliberate in measurements. For example, say you prepare a mixture that is slightly too concentrated. Someone takes it for a while, and complains that the effect is not strong enough, and they'd like to start a higher dosage. You're already out of the first batch and make another. This time, you make it slightly too dilute. Your \"customer\" takes what they think is a higher dose, which could be exactly what they need -- but they're actually unknowingly taking about the same amount when you factor in the disparity in concentration. Again, for this particular drug, it's not the end of the world *medically speaking*, but it makes it hard to adjust around patient needs. I would be losing my shit if this was something like insulin, because you could absolutely kill someone with improper dosages. The \"danger\" of DIY HRT is not entirely overblown. Everyone who goes that route should be doing so with full knowledge that there are risks, especially stemming from the manufacturer of the drug itself, as well as the equipment used and your preparation and administration. It should not be your FIRST choice, but it's often the only option people feel they have, and it's certainly not as risky as people make it out to be if you can find a reliable source. Our attitude to the rising necessity of DIY in response to increasing legal and institutional restrictions on access to \"legitimate\" (i.e. highly regulated and tested) HRT should obviously not be to decry the practice itself, but to create a sustainable system to do so safely. That is to say, there is a pressing need for a centrally-organized, accountable system of acquisition, preparation, distribution, and information on hormones, using manufacturers we trust and processing/shipping processes that minimize risk. The same is true for more clinically-significant medications under pressure of increasing lack of access, such as abortifacients and insulin -- things with more dire consequences for poor practices.\n\nI'll say it again more clearly: NO FUCKING BATHTUB INSULIN The supply chains for the safe and effective production of medicines are necessarily vast and impossible to reproduce without essentially building a new state in the process. But we don't need to do that; we just need to be conscientious in how we use existing supply lines.",

        "smushed_text": "*Everyone* tells jokes as a way to check temperature. It's generally not sinister or even conscious, but the role humor plays in social bonding is to simultaneously probe for and reinforce shared values, sensibilities, and backgrounds. https://t.co/5Nw5lzIExV When someone says something intended to be funny, everyone in earshot begins rapidly making a complicated series of subconscious mental checks. Parsing the joke may take a fraction of a second, but it draws on everything from experiential memory to linguistic biases. Nothing is \"objectively\" funny; it's all context-dependant. The same statement said to the same group of people can be funny in one setting and serious in another. Tone matters, timing matters, body language matters. All of these things add cues that may or may not be picked up. After zipping through a branching mental flowchart of experiences and values and immediate social cues, the depth and shape of which scientists still don't fully understand, the parts of your brain responsible for social reasoning make a final determination -- funny or not. A huge factor in this decision is observing the reactions of others around you. Laughter is an easy way to communicate each individual's decision and establish consensus. Every fraction of a second that you don't detect laughter, your brain nudges down the urge to do so yourself. Similarly, mere exposure to others' expression of humor -- even fabricated others, like a canned laugh track -- ticks that urge up, whether the initial response was humor or not. The immediate social cue actively breeds a sensation of humor and colors the interaction. As a group consensus is reached, the original speaker gets feedback. The speaker might feel pride or shame, inclusion or exclusion, depending on whether or not that consensus matched their intent. They may have had a joke fall flat, or have had a serious comment laughed off. They may even have just been *mocked*, by a group coming to a consensus that the comment was funny to *them*, at the speaker's expense. Or, simply, they may feel closer to a group of people they just brought joy through a demonstration of shared social language. Now again, this entire process *can* be more or less conscious. You can fake laughter, for example, to try and fit in with an emerging consensus, to intentionally establish a social connection even if you didn't \"naturally\" find something funny. (Think of how someone may be primed to laugh more readily or intensely with someone they find attractive.)\n\nA person can also tell a joke that is *specifically* constructed to select for a particular set of values: it's only funny if you agree with very explicit preconditions. This is likely what's being referenced in the phrase \"men don't tell jokes, they check temperature.\" The implication being that men are more likely to construct a statement that ensures laughter from an audience with certain (presumably sinister) values. Or, failing that, to probe for *passive acceptance* of those values in those present who don't genuinely share them. Whether you find it funny or not, simply not reacting with anger is a form of assent.\n\nLet's be clear: this use of humor is not any gender's exclusive domain. However, this does point us toward a crucial element of humor's role in cultural hegemony and moderating class interactions. Higher social status allows more leeway for the use of humor to compel assent, to ostracize the subaltern, or to prime subjects to reify hegemonic ideals. For example, in a given social context, someone may make a joke that relies on a social understanding of a particular oppressed class as having certain moral failings (think \"black people are lazy\" or \"trans women are perverts\"). Members of the audience may genuinely find it funny, because they share that conception. They may have previously not held that belief, but gained a new \"clarity\" through the social interaction: \"My peers/betters find this funny, so I guess it makes sense. Ha ha!\" Or they may find it outright objectionable, and continue to do so no matter the social priming, but they don't want to risk the consequences of expressing dissent. So they keep their objections to themselves, and the joke passes group consensus, reinforcing its \"acceptability.\" There is truly so much more to be said on this topic, including the dynamics of subaltern humor, the broader social trends of how comedy is mainstreamed, the intricacies of sarcasm, irony, and pastiche, comedic trends across cultures in history and globally, neurodivergence, etc. Suffice to say, humor is deceptively complicated. And it's only one of a million pathways through which the superstructure of a society disseminates, reinforces itself, adapts, and faces challenges. In the war of position, don't discount the comedic line.",

        "smushed_text": "Why are nations across the global south turning to China as a source of loans? The answer is simple. Poorer nations need capital to build infrastructure that will help them be less poor, and they have limited options to get it: selling off resources, IMF loans, or China. Granting companies from wealthy nations contracts to freely extract resources is what a lot of these nations have done in the past. It's why a lot of governments have come into power in the first place: the US has used its military might to put them there to ensure \"free trade.\" However, these trade deals only provide these nations with pennies on the dollar for the value of these resources. They don't uplift the citizens, who are either cut out of the process entirely or paid little to nothing for their labor. And graft is child's play in these cases. Additionally, after a century and a half of brutal colonization and military intervention that continues to this day, existing governments are acutely aware that failing to provide these sweetheart deals to the west may lead to coups to replace them with more amenable puppets. IMF loans, ostensibly designed to uplift poor countries and help them get on the track to self-sufficiency, actually do the opposite. These loans come with conditions that require governments to institute \"fiscally responsible\" policies that line up with IMF's economic orthodoxy. Specifically, they enforce austerity, cutting social programs. They insist on privatization so the government \"saves money,\" even though that means citizens cannot access services that now cost money. They push for deregulation, allowing companies to externalize their costs. So you can see why loans from China have appeal. They don't come with the implicit threat of military reprisal, and they don't come with conditions about how to spend the money. More importantly, they aren't sourced by the same western powers that oppressed them for so long. Obviously China isn't just doing this out of a sense of moral duty. These loans have interest payments attached, like all loans do, including IMF loans. The difference is that China recognizes that it is in its own best interest for these nations to be able to repay those loans. China isn't interested in sucking these nations dry for short-term gains. They want to build up a global network of nations more economically tied to China than to the west. And that necessarily means helping those nations succeed and grow. Rather than extractive trade deals designed to give western companies huge profit margins or IMF loans designed to bring them in line with libertarian economic doctrine, these nations increasingly prefer to deal with a partner that wants them to succeed. You can call it conniving all you want, but the end result is that people are being lifted out of poverty, which they weren't under the western model of intervention, extraction, and austerity.",

No matter how much effort you put into improving, if you're doing it wrong, you're actually just training bad habits. You need to follow a regiment that actually leads to the results you want. In the absence of a pre-established procedure, you need to figure it out from scratch. That requires an iterative process of experimentation, followed by deep analysis, followed by updating your procedure, followed by novel experimentation.\n\nIn other words... science. This is especially true for the practice of bringing about change in a deeply-broken society. We can see clearly that, whatever we're doing, it's not working. Many people keep plugging away, trying to change things, but change never arrives. We are practicing incorrectly. In the imperial core, there is a total lack of scientific investigation into the practice of creating change. There are many reasons for this, but the primary one is that we have been indoctrinated into liberalism, which purports to already *have* the proper procedure for change. But we can clearly see that the procedure we have been handed doesn't work--because it hasn't actually changed anything. When we practice within the liberal framework, we are practicing incorrectly. We are not improving our practice; only further entrenching bad habits. Luckily, we don't have to start over from scratch. Plenty of movements in the past have successfully brought about change. We can investigate what they did and begin our experimentation with adapted protocols. But that requires first acknowledging the need for experimentation.",

According to the Democrats, you HAVE to vote for them, otherwise the Republicans will destroy America--and vice versa. They present themselves as diametrically opposed. https://t.co/n3ASnBFy2z For Democrats to present themselves as the better option, they need to convince you that your choice matters, and there is a correct choice. That obviously means that you, as a rational person, should *always* vote for them, and so should everyone else. The ideal is 100% Dems. And yet, they claim to not want that. You should always vote for Dems, and yet they want there to magically be a 50/50 split in the end, so we can have a \"functioning democracy.\" This conflicting philosophy actually makes perfect sense once you understand what the parties are. The point of the electoral system in a bourgeois democracy is not to best represent the people's interests, but to create the illusion of choice between parties that each governs on behalf of the capitalist class. We can illustrate this with a thought experiment. Imagine that overnight, the entire Republican party disappeared. Some die, some retire, some \"see the light\" and switch parties. What would happen in the next election? Would the Dems see it as a victory for democracy that those no-good Republicans are out of the way? Obviously not. The party would split into \"left\" and \"right\" flanks, each once again positioning themselves as the only rational choice. Former Democrats across the spectrum, flanking the same \"center\" the current parties do. This would be necessary for a \"functioning democracy.\" Each party in a liberal democracy gains its legitimacy only in the context of opposition to the other parties. A one-party regime under capitalism would not have mass support; every policy would be graded directly on its impact on the working class, and would be found wanting. If Democrats governed alone and did all the things they do now, there would be uprisings every day. If they fulfilled the half measures they promise they really want (like $15 minimum wage), the people would quickly demand more, and those demands would be met with obstinance. A new left party would open up, promising $25/hr, and garnering an ever-increasing proportion of votes. But they'd somehow find themselves needing to \"compromise\" with an intractable old guard. They'd water down the proposed reforms to reach some ill-defined \"centrist voter.\" By the time the two parties are neck-and-neck, their policy proposals would look roughly the same again. The one-party duopoly would be restored, with a refreshed veneer of \"left-right compromise.\" Worker exploitation, imperialism, and white supremacy would be maintained.",

        "smushed_text": "There's a very good reason behind a lot of peculiarities of COVID-19: dysregulation of the innate immune system. This phenomenon can explain:\n1) Pre-symptomatic transmission\n2) Vaccines preventing serious illness much more effectively than transmission\n3) Case fatality Your immune system has 2 main pathways: innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity is a generalized response that happens as soon as infection is detected to wipe it out quickly. Adaptive immunity is a more targeted response, once your immune system has identified the source. Part of innate immune response involves recruitment of macrophages, specialized cells that recognize pathogen-associated molecules and engulf them. This kick-starts pathways that encourage stronger immune response, including inflammation and priming the adaptive immune system. Inflammation and other immune responses are actually responsible for most of the symptoms you experience when you get sick. Uncontrolled inflammation is also a huge factor in the death rate of a lot of diseases, especially coronaviruses. During early infection, dendritic cells and macrophages present antigens from the virus to teach your adaptive immune system what to target with antibodies. Vaccines allow your immune system to skip to this step without needing to be infected. SARS-CoV-2 has the ability to infect macrophages and suppress expression of interferon, which is normally very important for restricting viral replication in the early stages of infection. This means that for the first little while, the virus spreads without you noticing. In addition to suppressed interferon production, SARS-CoV-2-infected macrophages seem to have uncontrolled production of pro-inflammation molecules, which is likely to contribute to the multisystem inflammatory syndrome that is responsible for a lot of the mortality in COVID-19. It is possible that this ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect macrophages and suppress the recruitment of the adaptive immune system contributes to its ability to get up to a high enough viral load to infect others while you're still asymptomatic. It also lends insight to why immunity from vaccination and prior infection does not provide as robust protection against reinfection or transmission as we see with other diseases. The adaptive immune response is slowed, so the virus gets to spread for a while. Vaccination is still pretty effective at preventing serious illness, because that adaptive response will still come, and it will be better prepared to end the infection quickly compared to a naive immune system.

And that's just the ones that get reported on. The people society deems undeserving of dignity and having their basic needs met -- whether they're homeless, disabled, prostitutes, addicts, etc. -- are subject to death and grievous harm in droves, either actively or passively.

Immigrants, queer people, indigenous people, black people, and many other social categories -- whose status in society is subjected to the scorn of bourgeois sensibilities -- are demonstrably LESS safe.

In the US, women are 20% more likely to be in poverty, and, as with other oppressed groups, the more precarious their position, the more their *actual* safety collapses. They become increasingly subjected to gendered violence as they get pushed further into the economic margins. Us leftists saying you don't deserve to feel safe are simply saying that your FEELINGS of safety do not trump the ACTUAL safety of oppressed people.

Its usefulness is running dry. https://t.co/5GDtGRfi8D From the beginning, Israel acted as a launching pad for imperial intervention, especially with assistance in regime change operations and the capture and negotiation for the return of tactically significant territory. Some notable examples include:\n\nThe Suez crisis, where Israel worked on behalf of the dying British and French empires to secure Red Sea shipping.\n\nThe infiltration of Syria's government and military by Israeli spies to empower anti-Egypt forces. The normalization treaties with Egypt, Jordan, and UAE, exchanging demilitarization for open trade with the west, once amenable (collaborationist) governments had been assured.\n\nIt's not just Israel's mere presence in the region -- it's its military actions. What the Palestinian resistance is doing right now is shattering the illusion of IOF supremacy. No matter how well supplied it is by the US, Israel now only has the power to ravage civilian populations, not fight against an organized military, let alone the entire Arab world. However, the surrounding states would never join the fight under the current collaborationist regimes, who are enticed and empowered by western capital. They have no incentive to divest themselves from the same empire that assured them their power, and threatens their stability. That is exactly why the international arm of the resistance's strategy is so focused on hampering shipment of goods out and weapons in. The worst outcome for the empire, and the primary horizon of Palestinian liberation, is an Arab world divested from US interests. The end of collaboration would send shockwaves across the entire world, destroying the US's entire geopolitical strategy. Unfortunately for them, that strategy relies on a projection of unshakeable military hegemony. And that hegemony has been revealed for the paper tiger it is.",

Once in position, each rank of firearm-equipped infantry would fire in unison, shattering and dispersing enemy formations. As soon as the first rank finished firing, they would get out of the way (typically by crouching or moving into a column) and reload, while the next rank fired off a second volley. You can repeat this process until you run out of ranks and/or ammunition. This tactic was very useful as a form of saturation fire: bombarding the enemy with a large volume of lethal, ranged attacks. The same basic tactic as flurries of archer fire in antiquity or artillery bombardment in WWI. It is used for suppressing and redirecting enemy movement. That was the value of the line formation: stand your ground, suppress the enemy, and set the stage for a charge to mop up the enemy without giving them a chance to advance on your position. Armies were never composed solely of line infantry, and the lines weren't immutable. First of all, they typically didn't slowly march in lines. They moved in fluid columns, then reformed into lines once they neared their objective.\n\nBattalions protected their flanks as best they could, and had separate formations of skirmishers waiting in the wings. One way this myth of the \"inflexible, useless line\" often comes up is a false narrative of the American war of independence. The story we're told is that the torpid, sclerotic British troops were consistently outflanked by rascally American minutemen. In truth, the rebels were routed over and over by the organized, suppressive volleys of the redcoats. It was only once the militias were subsumed into a central command structure, with regimented tactics and operational standards, that the Americans were able to make headway. So what was Napoleon's true military genius? Simple: he was even MORE organized! Napoleon heavily emphasized logistics, setting up roads and supply depots to ensure speedy deployment and a consistent supply of food and materiel to the front lines. He famously used this rapid deployment to outflank his enemies and cut off *their* ability to reinforce and rearm their flagging front lines. And his eventual downfall came from him outstripping those same supply lines, pushing too far away from the logistical engine, too fast. Moral of the story: wars aren't won by being disorganized and \"hard to pin down.\" They're won by controlling your enemy's movement, securing your own, and building the logistical and tactical infrastructure to keep that machine going for longer than your opponents.",

        "smushed_text": "\"Meeting people where they are\" does not mean letting them stay where they are. We are here to change everything, not just the things the average person is already on board with changing, and that requires challenging some widespread assumptions about how the world works. (1/21) If someone believes, for example, that men are intrinsically more rational than women, or that different races have different psychologies, you don't \"meet them where they are\" by allowing them to continue believing that. You find a way to directly confront and overcome that. If someone believes the universe is buffeted about by arcane, metaphysical forces, knowable only through mystical ritual and esoteric indoctrination, rather than materialism, they are similarly hampered in the pursuit of revolution, and those beliefs need to be overcome as well. If someone has a conception of \"progress\" that leaves room for a national or gender hierarchy, that conception requires serious education to excise. Same for if their political vision is eugenicist, idealist, or otherwise ill-suited for the world in which we exist. Our purpose as revolutionaries is not to \"appeal\" to people on a thin basis of \"shared values\" so we can \"convert\" them to supporting our \"message.\" We are trying to fundamentally restructure every aspect of social existence. Our goal is complete transformation, at every stratum. This transformation requires the complete destruction of regressive thought. It takes time, it takes concerted effort, and yes, it takes compromise and tact. But it cannot be done by ceding ideological ground from the start. We need to begin the war of position. The key thing to understand is that you can't really \"change minds.\" People change their *own* minds, and they do so for a number of reasons beyond simply hearing a well-reasoned argument. Certain individuals may change their views based on evidence and debate, but not en masse. People tend to construct their worldviews based on what *feels* right, and that's largely based on social context. This is why, for example, you can convince an entire population to wear masks to avoid illness -- and then if you convince enough to stop, it becomes anathema. Masks became hegemonic, the unquestioned norm among a vast cohort of the population. Now, NOT wearing a mask is hegemonic, and convincing someone it's still as useful as ever is as much a nonstarter as convincing them that skipping is a better form of locomotion than walking. Maybe you could find a few individuals willing to hear out your rational argument. But for most, the immediate response is \"Yeah, whatever. If it was *that much better*, then why is no one doing it??\" You could even explain WHY no one is -- it still wouldn't change their mind. The same is true with religion, spirituality, and even superstition, with people's beliefs being directly informed by social context, leading to people claiming the same belief system having wildly different conceptions of the \"fundamental tenets\" of those beliefs. Multiple Christians, for example, might have completely opposite views on homosexuality, with both claiming their beliefs are rooted in the teachings of Jesus. Individuals may even adapt those views based on social context without feeling like their precepts have changed. People often become more or less religious out of \"habit,\" as they become acculturated to new social contexts -- or recommitted to engaging with their existing one -- rather than out of any explicit interrogation of the \"correctness\" of a particular belief. People can become more or less ANYTHING in a similar way. Someone can live their entire life with the concept of transness being completely foreign to them, and not even question their gender. Even after being exposed to the concept, it might not click until years later. In this sense, transness *is* being \"spread\" socially, with more people becoming aware of what it means and what the implications are for themselves -- and then deliberately integrating themselves into social contexts that allow them to evolve their self-conception. And the same is true in all political spheres. Liberalism is hegemonic, as are bourgeois conceptions of family, gender, nation, ability, what it means to be a good citizen, what it means to be a good person, what society owes you, what you owe society, etc. People can enter \"radical spaces\" and become acculturated in an environment with specific notions of appropriate values, methods, language, and even the furthest horizon of political aims. Their relationship to existing ideals is modulated by these constructed political environs. Since these spaces are constructed by people who were *also* acculturated by a broader social context, if there is not an explicit program for rooting out regressive notions, the spaces become little more than the reproductive cells of liberalism -- albeit a mutated liberalism. They reify liberal precepts whose logic they don't even question. They instill and reinforce in their fellow-travelers liberal concepts of how to engage with existing institutions, they carry forward hegemonic forms of chauvinism, they fail to overcome passivity and complicity. In their quest for \"power\" and \"relevance,\" they deliberately make themselves \"big tents,\" allowing regressivism and counter-revolutionary ideals past the baggage check. They may want to be progressive, but they are powerless against the regressivism they refused to challenge. So congratulations on meeting people where they are. You have waded into the muck to try and reach them, and you have successfully avoided making them thrash and sink deeper. Now what is your plan to get both them AND you out? (21/21)",

The structure of organized labor also needs substructure and superstructure.\n\nThe substructure is the activism and networks of rank-and-file members. The superstructure is the cooperation of union federations. Superstructure is important for coordination of tactics, solidarity actions, setting priorities, and putting boots on the ground. It is crucial for multiplying our efforts, making sure that all of our fights get escalated and executed to the maximum level. Sufficiently advanced union federations across industries and trades can direct and support all members of the working class. They could provide massive strike funds, fill out pickets, train organizers, dictate legislation, support displaced workers, and more. Substructure is crucial as the engine of the labor movement. Workers who are deeply engaged, know each other, highly trained organizers, and most importantly, have endless contingency plans in place. Expect capital to constantly undermine us, and be ready to rebuff and rebuild. The ability of an empowered substructure to constantly reengage rank-and-file workers, even without the legal entity of a union is of utmost importance.\n\nA powerful labor movement needs to be able to ignore blatantly anti-union laws, such as prohibition against sympathy strikes. This means if a union is decertified for violating unjust regulations, its former members need to be ready to jump in and form a union again. They need to be capable of wildcat strikes, in which workers are protected not by legal stricture, but by economic sway over the boss. Without these substructures and superstructures in place, unions naturally default to the service model: negotiating contracts, filing grievances, and slowly hemorrhaging disaffected members. When \"demands\" aren't met, these unions have no recourse to offer their members. So how do we rebuild these crucial elements of the movement?\n\nOn an individual level, that means YOU getting as engaged as possible in your union, with your coworkers, with everyone you know.

Yes, we are revolutionaries: that is our mission, and it's the lens through which we refine our practice. But the light we shine through that lens is analytical. And analysis requires data. (1/11) The data of history comes through the sources who lived it. Sometimes through their writing, sometimes through oral retellings, sometimes through material clues they left behind. (2/11) All are subject to being skewed through the passage of time: details dramatized or forgotten in oral traditions, biases and lost context in written words, fragmentation and erosion of material culture.\n\nHindsight is not 20/20. It passes through the frosted window of time. (3/11) Sometimes, it is up to modern historians to piece together narratives from these warped fragments to try and make sense of them. But to do so as objectively as possible, we need to understand the history as it exists. (4/11) Central to all of this is language. Thousands of languages, tens of thousands of years of evolution, an untold number of regional nuances in between. They cannot be so easily parsed with just one common tongue.\n\nThe work of Marxists is to make sense of these fragments... (5/11) ... and without the language to do so, we are completely in the dark. That is why we have a duty to preserve languages \u2013 and also to build literacy.\n\nMarxist literacy builds a common language: a shared, mutual, unambiguous, and uncompromising understanding. (6/11) Understanding with which all this raw data can be synthesized and disseminated. But that effort is pointless without the ability to collect that data.\n\nWe must preserve the native languages of all of our peoples: (7/11) The dialects, the traditions, the cultural nuances \u2013 not just because it is \"good\" and \"just,\" but because it maintains a direct line of communication with our collective history.\n\nMarxists must be bilingual. (8/11) Not necessarily in the petty sense of knowing two languages; we only need some of our movement to have this particular skill. But in the broader sense of having literacy in two realms: the realm of context and the realm of communication. (9/11) We must be able to understand our history and our people, the context of how our current conditions came to be. And we must also understand each other, to communicate what we know with a million-tongued movement.(10/11) Marxists are scientists and historians, and we are also translators. By preserving cultural literacy and building collective literacy, we create the common language of liberation: the communist language. (11/11) For a practical example of what it means for Marxists to act as the translators of history, check out the work Chunka Luta does, interviewing elders and preserving their words for the rest of the movement:\n\nhttps://t.co/PKcyEacjRY",

The implication becomes \"If this ends up affecting you, you were retroactively 'at-risk,' and should have figured out how to protect yourself.\" https://t.co/ICFGFYACva I don't like to throw around the term \"eugenics,\" but that's explicitly what it is. \"Public health\" is not about keeping the public healthy by preventing illness: it's about passively allowing the \"weak\" to die or retreat from public life, so that only the healthy remain visible. Aside from the obvious moral reprehensibility of simply discarding entire segments of the population, this approach is a literal death spiral. Because \"healthy\" is not a permanent status. You can become disabled at the drop of a hat, through injury, infection, aging, and more. As soon as you do -- and again, EVERYONE will, as they age -- you are no longer eligible for protection by the \"public health-by-default\" system, whose only purpose is to maintain a minimal baseline so that the *entire* city doesn't die of dysentery at once (1% is fine, though). Now is the time for revolutionary organizing. Mutual aid is a good start, but it simply cannot fill the social gap left by a state that is explicitly pursuing a policy of social murder. We need to form a public health corps. We need labor, infrastructure, materials, expertise. Most of all, we need organizational discipline and ambition. We need a commitment and a plan to challenge the hegemonic liberal political order that is actively destroying the health of our entire society. We need to divest public health from capital entirely. I'm working on a model for this as we speak. Obviously, I don't know everything, and obviously I can't DO anything on my own. I'm actively seeking guidance and collaboration from anyone and everyone committed to the goal of building a revolutionary public health apparatus. DM me!",

I do find it pretty hilarious how often I'm seeing variations on \"And why was the church able to organize opposition? \ud83e\udd28\" or \"Why did they even leave it up to a vote?\"\n\nAs if these same people wouldn't decry \"AUTHORITARIAN REDFASH TANKIES!\" for crushing all opposition. The goal wasn't simply to let gay people get married, it was to completely transform society through building population-level familiarity with a variety of nuanced topics from queerness to subtle forms of gender bias in domestic roles to the agency of children and elders. They didn't just decree from on high \"This is the law now. Take it or take it.\" That would create the perfect environment for breeding regressive backlash. Y'know, kind of like how US conservatives have spent the entire time since Roe v. Wade obsessed with getting it overturned? The Cuban communists have enough respect for their own people to trust that they could learn and grow out of centuries of regressive cultural norms. Those religiously-informed \"common sense\" notions of the \"natural family\" didn't stand a chance against this level of education. The people of Cuba made this law, not some disconnected ruling class deciding what's best for them. And as result, it is now rooted deeply into the soil of social life. It would take nothing less than a bloody counter-revolution, overturning the whole society to destroy this law. Compare that to the US's feeble grasp on \"gay rights\": a 9-year-old statement issued by 5 unelected judges saying \"yeah I guess the gays can marry if they want.\" The current supreme Court has Obergefell in its crosshairs as we speak. The population of the US has no ownership over any of the \"rights\" (really, temporary privileges) afforded by a compendium of laws and court rulings that govern our lives. For every protection, there is a powerful coalition working to overthrow it, and they have bases of support. Queer people are in tremendous danger here, and we have no one to protect us but ourselves. In Cuba, not only is there a strong state, run by a party regimented under the banner of liberation, but there's also an entire society that has collectively affirmed those rights we lack. (Also, it's hilarious to point to the power of the churches to counter-organize, when that is the direct result of US-based evangelical organizations pumping money into the most regressive Cuban churches. Again, if this was cracked down on, liberals would whine about that too!)",

These units are largely rented out to low-income people -- \"proletarian workers\" being exploited by \"bourgeois workers.\" https://t.co/SBlUULFaTq The US market for domestic labor (childcare, housecleaning, yard work, etc.) currently sits at $30,000,000,000/year, and is rapidly growing, almost entirely due to the growth of labor aristocrat wealth. Hundreds of billions more are spent on food delivery. Of course, that consumption isn't a strict bourgeois-proletarian relationship, in that the purchaser of the labor isn't using it to directly generate more capital. Instead, the labor is used to free up their time, allowing them to work for much better pay and generate wealth. That wealth is largely built in the form of real estate, buying more and more property to either sell at a profit (which requires a constantly inflating housing market) or rent out (again, causing them to benefit from higher housing costs). They also do use their superwages to purchase capital, in the form of stock. The wealthiest 10% of the US population -- EXCLUDING the \"super-rich\" top 1% -- own 40% of all stocks. That's 30 million people holding $25 trillion in capital (plus another $33 trillion in real estate). Another 130 million Americans collectively hold $48 trillion in wealth.\n\nThere is a very sharp divide between exploiter and exploited in just this country, let alone the whole world.

(3/25) I have many reasons for my skepticism, but a lot of it boils down to the problem of organizational development across the movement as a whole. The constitution of a federation of local communist organizations requires those organizations to actually... exist. (4/25) To be perfectly blunt, they don't. Not in the form they need to be. There are many small groups I'm aware of -- and many more besides -- that are absolutely on the right track. Principled Marxists, committed to revolution, self-aware of their current and future role, etc. (5/25) But let's be clear: you and your 6 study buddies meeting once a week to discuss the next section of Blood in My Eye are not a Communist Organization. Even if you also do a bit of food distribution. Rather, you are the core cell of what could *become* such an organization. (6/25) Many of these groups recognize this, and are actively struggling to develop themselves into what they know they need to be. They are trying to figure out how to recruit new members, how to educate themselves, how to serve and empower their communities, etc. (7/25) The key here is that the utmost priority for these groups has to be reproduction of communists. This can only be done through a carefully calibrated, mutually-reinforcing circuit of mass work and political education. The nature of such a circuit is highly context-dependent (8/25) The mass work directly ties the org into the community, materially empowers the working class, gives members practical experience in providing necessary services, and crucially, pulls an expanding number of nascent radicals into the orbit of the organization. (9/25) Political education draws the most advanced among those supporters into the org proper, develops the theoretical understanding of existing members, clarifies the immediate and long-term political mission of the org, and expands the labor capacity of the movement. (10/25) That expanded capacity feeds directly back into the mass work, which feeds back into the development, and so on. The organization simultaneously grows in size, skill, influence, radicalism, and professionalism. Its horizons begin to expand exponentially. (11/25) This process takes both deliberate, yet ambitious planning, as well as time and consistency. The careful work of building out a durable apparatus for reliably reproducing communists cannot be supplanted by sheer force of will and declaring \"We are now a communist party!\" (12/25) Relevant to the topic of the conference, which aims to create an organization of organizations, this beginning stage of consolidating into a reproductive cell requires 100% of an organization's efforts. ALL labor must be invested into the work of expanding labor capacity. (13/25) Being folded into an existing structure, already equipped with the infrastructure for efficiently developing these local orgs into cadre formations, would be a boon to this effort. Helping to *build* that structure -- crafting the infrastructure from scratch -- is not. (14/25) Properly building the infrastructure of a pre-party formation is a massive undertaking. It can only be accomplished by highly developed, organizationally experienced Marxists. We may have individually well-read Marxists, but the organizational expertise is not there. (15/25) Taking on this task at this stage is like asking college freshmen to build a research lab from scratch, when none of us have even worked in an existing lab. We may have passion, and we may read the advice of our distant forebears, but we have no experience to draw on. (16/25) That's not to say a conference in and of itself is a bad idea. Collaboration among equals in inexperience is critical at this stage of development, if we ever want to progress to the next. The goal right now is cross-pollination, mutually empowering local orgs to develop. (17/25) A conference of this sort would not be aimed at federating non-existent advanced orgs, but on developing a program for transforming nascent orgs into advanced ones. This would necessitate a much different format from the one adopted by the present conference. (18/25) It would be virtual, to allow attendance by all interested parties. An in-person conference filters out those who can't afford to travel, either for organizational reasons (insufficient resources and/or labor) or individual ones (taking time off work or caretaking). (19/25) I do want to point out that this conference *is* hybrid. It hasn't exactly been advertised that way, but having a virtual component definitely helps those who couldn't otherwise attend. It would have a set curriculum and series of discussions, educating Marxists on the necessary steps for forming/developing their orgs. The topics could include:\n\n- How to gather together an organizing committee to begin the formation of an org. (20/25) - How to conduct social investigation to determine the immediate mass work priorities of the new org\n\n- A collaborative workshop on setting bylaws and organizational structure for all Marxist orgs\n\n- How to establish and run internal educational programs. (21/25) - A set of standard operating procedures for orgs to follow and maintain security, stability, and ease of sustaining operating capacity\n\n- How to document and report the experiences of the org for dissemination among other locals. (22/25) - How to set an ambitious but realistic 5 year plan for the development of the org\n\n- Establishing shared benchmarks of development for individual orgs and measures of when the movement has developed enough to be able to transition to party formation (23/25) - A schedule for future cross-organizational meetings to update shared procedures and report on progress toward the benchmarks, as well as brainstorm on overcoming setbacks.\n\nThese and other topics could be spread across multiple meetings depending on the orgs' capacity. (24/25) All told, the conference itself is not a waste of time. But the prospect of a fruitful federation being built from it is woefully na\u00efve.\n\nI hope the attendees come away from it with a better understanding of how much farther we must develop before we can move into the next stage.",

No. Everything was already set up for the self-reinforcing circuit of fossil fuel use -&gt; heavy industry -&gt; imperial conquest -&gt; resource extraction -&gt; fossil fuel use. Backing out at any stage, by any player, would have meant defeat. Investing in that emerging, untested, small-scale technology would mean losing out on short-term profits -- profits that get reinvested to accumulate long-term profits. There's a reason the imperial powers were able to keep the rest of the world in shackles.

The battlefields of this war have been slowly emerging over the past several decades, shaped by the imperial ambitions of cartelized western capital, the inexorable onset of climate change, the rise of China, and of course, national liberation struggles across the global south. No single issue can be viewed in isolation. Only the complete landscape of global, interconnected struggles can give us a picture of what the future holds, and how we can shape it.

That's based on the (inaccurate) notion that most of the viable virus is found in large droplets, which sink before they can be inhaled. This has been debunked over and over: the virus remains viable even into tiny particles that can stay suspended and spread through the air like smoke. And the mechanics of transmission have a LOT to do with how much of what you exhale ends up as this viral \"smoke.\" In the winter, the air gets very dry. Cold air can't hold as much water, so the humidity plummets. In this environment, the larger respiratory droplets rapidly lose their water--and their mass. They become tiny particles, easily suspended in the air and spread long distances. This is a pattern we've known for a long time for other airborne viruses, hence winter's reputation as flu season, RSV season, and so forth.\n\nEvery year, the CDC quietly puts out vague warnings about how we'll see a winter uptick in respiratory disease, without explaining *why*. Bottom line: wear a respirator in public EVEN OUTSIDE. The chance of you walking through an invisible cloud of suspended viral aerosol increases dramatically at low humidity.\n\nI know it sucks, but please be safe.

        "smushed_text": "So this is actually the chauvinism I was talking about. When presented with the reality of a huge mass of oppressed people choosing to align themselves with the enemies of their oppressors, your first thought probably shouldn't be \"Wow, they must so gullible!\" https://t.co/h2KrX0jAcU Start with the understanding that:\n\n1) oppressed people actively seek their own liberation,\n\n2) given the chance, they will choose the option they believe materially improves their circumstances,\n\n3) they are not any more gullible or less capable of critical analysis than you. Given these three (hopefully uncontroversial) concepts, we can then rephrase the question \"Why are they so gullible?\" as two questions:\n\n\"Why do they see Russia (or China, or Iran, or Hamas, etc.) as a way to improve their circumstances?\"\n\nand\n\n\"Why do I disagree with them?\" These can be difficult questions to answer, and I'm happy to go into more detail if you want. But maintaining the stance of \"oppressed people are not stupid, cowardly, or inept\" can certainly guide you in analyzing the situation for yourself. One thing to think about is the way the west approaches \"aid,\" which comes with explicit prescriptions of how these colonized nations must run their governments and their economic policies: no nationalizing resources, no welfare programs, no getting in the way of western capital. Contrast this approach with China's philosophy of \"south-south cooperation.\" They attach no explicit policy to their aid -- just the general goodwill between mutually respectful nations that they see as forming an economic bloc that is increasingly free of western hegemony. You can be skeptical of this goodwill if you want. Just remember that it's easy to be skeptical when it's not *your* roads, hospitals, and people on the line. These nations are making the calculated choice to enter into this arrangement over the extortion offered by the west. (Until I see evidence to the contrary, I am choosing to assume this person is legitimately seeking answers, and is *not* trying to be chauvinist. I'm far more interested in trying to answer as best I can than in cheap dunks, and I'd ask anyone else who sees this not to dogpile.)",

But these chauvinists are also erasing the rich -- and growing -- Marxist tradition of movements across Asia, the middle east, Africa, South America, and yes, right here in North America. It is the ideology of liberation. The organized forces of oppressed peoples, making themselves into armies capable of taking on forces ten times their size. It's the movement of the colonized, the imprisoned, the brutalized, the displaced, the ostracized. Call us \"authoritarian\" all you want: we are simply responding in kind.

The spies returned with giant fruits and tales of giant inhabitants. The Jews freaked out at the thought of facing down such monstrous enemies, and Yahweh got angry with them for doubting that he could deliver the land to them. As punishment, they were told to wander around the Sinai desert for 40 years, until everyone who complained had died. In the early days of the Israeli monarchy, under King Saul, the Jews faced constant threat from the \"Plishtim,\" AKA Philistines AKA the root word for \"Palestine.\" They were a monstrous people that had to be killed to ensure the security of the Israelis. Among them was, famously, the giant Goliath, who Yahweh helped David kill with a single strike from his sling. Later, David would singlehandedly slaughter 200 Palestinians, circumcise their corpses, and bring back their foreskins as a dowry to marry Saul's daughter. You get the point? Giant, evil, godless monsters, whose only purpose is to destroy what the good, noble children of God try to build, fated to be wiped off the face of the Earth to bring in an age of peace.\n\nFascist propaganda never changes.",

I retreat into the comfort of climate controlled buildings and cheap bananas while babies are caked in dust. My torment is immense, but it's all psychic. There is no glory in suffering, but neither is there in avoiding it. What agony am I willing to bear in pursuit of liberation? Nothing but my own mind? What do I lack but peace of mind? How far would I go? What excuses could I hope to muster in the face of this truth? That I am worth preserving. That my safety and stability is paramount. That somehow I, more than any of the 10,000 slaughtered, have some magic to offer the global movement that is worth protecting through cowardice. My sedation is upheld by those who care for me. In their wisdom and their sympathy, they gently guide me toward \"self-care\" and \"doing what I can.\" I can be of no use to anyone if I \"burn myself out.\"\n\nComplacency and complicity disguised as tactical triage. And how dare I? What gives me the right to feel these things about myself, let alone utter them? I elicit pity for these words, but really, it is anger. Because if I feel useless, if I am a failure, then so is everyone else who stands by and does nothing. And that is an affront. And what use would I be anywhere else? I can't be a soldier, for I am weak. I can't be a tactician, for I am inexperienced. I can't be a medic, for I am untrained. I can't be a theoretician, for their theory surpasses my own -- they already make real whatever words I could write. Useless here, useless there. At least there I could learn. There I could grow. There I could hear what they need from me and struggle to give it. There I would suffer, but here I suffer regardless. Suffering is useless and irrelevant: only my labor serves a purpose. Here, my labor serves empire. There, my labor would serve liberation  Here, my labor is teeth sinking into the throat of the world. There, my labor would be a balm on the wounds rent in my name. Here, my labor traps me. There, my labor would free me. The choice now is whether to continue in \"building a life\" for myself, constructing my own prison of comfort and security, or whether to change course entirely.

(1/8) The vast majority of contemporary intellectuals before the August Revolution of 1945, including students, belonged to the petty bourgeoisie. In general, they were also oppressed by imperialism and feudalism, often unemployed and uneducated. (2/8) The petty bourgeoisie were intellectually and politically sensitive. They did not directly exploit labor. Therefore, they easily absorbed revolutionary education and went along with the workers and peasants. (3/8) However, the intelligentsia and students often suffer from great weaknesses, such as: theory not being coupled with practice, contempt for labor, vague ideas, unstable stances, and erratic behavior in political action. (4/8) Some other petty bourgeoisie (scientists and small businessmen, freelancers, etc.) were also exploited by imperialism and feudalism. Their economic circumstances were precarious, and they often found themselves unemployed and bankrupt. (5/8) Therefore, the majority also participated in and supported the resistance war and revolution. They are also important allies of the working class. In general, these members of the petty bourgeoisie had a number of weaknesses: (6/8) Self-interest, fragmentation, and a lack of determination.\n\nTherefore, the working class has a duty to agitate and spread propaganda to such members of the petty bourgeoisie, organize them, and help them to develop their strong points while correcting their weaknesses. (7/8) It is necessary to skillfully lead them, make them determined to serve the people, reform their ideology, and unite with the workers and peasants in order to become one cohesive movement. Then, they will become a great asset for the public in resistance war and revolution.\" (8/8) [NOTE: This analysis is particular to the conditions of Vietnam, and is only generalizable to the extent that *specific* fractions among the petty bourgeoisie exhibit similar tendencies. In the US, the majority of the petty bourgeoisie do not align with working class interests.] [NOTE (cont.): There are many reasons for this, many of which also apply to the US working class writ large, given their position within the empire. However, both \"petty bourgeois\" and \"settler working class\" are categories that warrant in depth analysis beyond a twitter thread.]",

You people sound like the centuries of physicians who continued to unquestioningly cite Galen, even when autopsies contradicted his claims. Unlike Galen, Lenin actually did autopsies of his own. But he still didn't cure -- or even discover/characterize -- every disease that would ever emerge. It's frankly alarming that anyone calling themselves a Marxist would treat any given individual as a source of eternal truth.",

Especially in a *new* society, where a core group of people still hold an idealized view of the old social order. Fascism is a paradoxical ideology, in which an imagined old is held as a paragon, but the driving force is desire for violent upheaval. Fascists view themselves simultaneously as change-bringers, reinvigorating a sclerotic culture, and as stalwart protectors against degradation. That base is manipulated by powerful interests. Forces that don't give a shit about \"traditional values\" or \"cultural stagnation,\" and are entirely motivated by avarice. In a nascent socialist society, those forces and the regressive instincts they prey upon will still exist. We can see how this has played out in socialist projects like the USSR and China. Even as these states emerged and unseated capital, the eternal spirit of fascism AND capitalism persisted. During the collapse of the USSR, they seized their chance and installed themselves. So it's less that capitalism inevitably decays into fascism. *Any* social structure in decay is vulnerable to regressive elements seizing and consolidating power. Fascism feeds on some of the nastiest natural inclinations in the human psyche, and must be treated as such.",

The primary reason for asking to join was that they wanted to expose it as a blatantly anti-communist, US-led system of puppet states. But they were also totally on board with the possibility of actually joining and potentially ending the cold war. Churchill actually lobbied for this in the hopes of achieving peace. The Soviet proposal kept getting reworked internally, deliberately leaving plenty of room for western powers to accept it on their terms. They were even willing to accept a partially rearmed West Germany. In the end, it was rejected on the grounds that the USSR joining was incompatible with NATO's \"defensive aims,\" thereby exposing its role, not as a defensive treaty, but an explicitly anti-Russian arrangement.

        "smushed_text": "The greatest lie ever told by western \"democracies\" is that elections = democracy. The implication being that, as long as the people have the final say in who leads them, those people will act as their \"representatives.\"\n\nWe know this process isn't working for the people. Public polling shows that people are increasingly aware that the government is not serving their interests, and serves a small group of powerful people instead. The blame is often laid at the feet of corporate donations helping pro-corporate candidates win elections. But it goes so much deeper than that. The entire electoral process was *designed* to launder public sentiment without too much danger of needing to actually serve the people.\n\nA good way to think of this is the \"sham elections\" of fascist Italy, Germany, and Japan. We all intuitively understand that an election where ballots have a giant \"Ja,\" a tiny \"Nein,\" (plus armed security forces) don't actually tell us what the people really want.\n\nSo why did they even run these elections if they didn't care about the people's will? Several reasons. https://t.co/r4dQn14Zvg We often think of \"legitimization\" in the context of these sham elections supposedly demonstrating to the outside world that the regime has popular support.\n\nThe \"legitimacy\" is actually for the base. And it's not exactly a trick, just an empty affirmation. The simple act of affirmatively voting for the ruling party helps build a sense of loyalty in the base. This means they're more likely to comply with the party's policies, act as \"citizen deputies,\" socially pressure their neighbors, and create a culture of unity. For these regimes, the point of the election is not as a way of making the government responsive to the people, it's to make a specific, galvanized subset of the people feel an enhanced allegiance to the party. You're probably thinking \"Of course, but those are repressive, one-party regimes. My country has *real* democracy, with multiple parties who need to compete for your vote!\"\n\nExcept your options are not really \"choices\" in the sense of you deciding how the government is run. Think about your options as a well-informed voter. You already know what the candidates and their parties stand for. You know who sort of aligns with your values and who is absolutely NOT an option.\n\nIn other words, for you, the ballot already has a huge \"Ja\" and a tiny \"Nein.\" The goal of every party in a representative democracy is to convince as many people as possible that they are the obvious, only choice. If they can do that without actually changing their policies, they will.\n\nSo why won't they ever push for pro-people policies? Here we get to the impact of capital.\n\nAs long as there is \"competition\" between parties, elections require financial resources to pay staff, market the party, rent space, etc. A party with no money is not really a party: it's just a philosophy club. The tougher the competition between parties, the more money that's necessary for their existence. This is such a fundamental structural truth that it's not even a question of parties being \"corrupted\" by money. It's more that they are actively *built* by capital. Bourgeois revolutions throughout history were, in essence, ways to establish capital as the deciding force in governmental affairs, rather than heredity and force. This was presented to the people as democratic liberalization, that now \"anyone can rule if they win elections!\" The fact that the goal was never to give power to \"the people\" should be made pretty obvious by who was allowed to vote in the beginning stages of these bourgeois democracies: property-holders. Constitutions were invariably drafted by the holders of capital. Suffrage was granted in stages, only once it became more disruptive to the political order to deny the vote than to admit new groups into the process.\n\nWhen that suffrage is deemed too disruptive, it is simply abrogated. Either by legislative, administrative, or military means. There is no real danger to capital of needing to give up its hegemony as a result of the government it helped create. Instead, electoral politics gives it a pressure gauge to determine how seriously it should take public discontent and what to do about it. Reforms, when they happen, are made as short-term concessions to relieve some of that tension. They are made with the understanding that they can always be undone within the \"democratic\" framework, and that capital will not need to accept a permanent loss of power. Democratic \"rights\" in this context are only portrayed in that way to absolve the ruling class of the consequences of their hegemony. But they are deliberately set up in a way to mitigate class-based solidarity, and divide the working class into manageable constituencies. By \"allowing\" these constituencies to vote in their atomized self-interests, and ensuring those interests do not align along class lines, capital is able to continue operating in the same spirit as the sham elections of fascist regimes. When class interests become too coherent and mobilized, those constituencies must simultaneously be reasserted and realigned in opposition to class solidarity. Hence, fascism and anticommunism go hand-in-hand. It's also why fascism comes with a breakdown in \"democratic norms.\" If the goal of electoralism is to reinforce constituent politics over class solidarity, fascism can handle that just fine, by using extrajudicial means to continuously and violently fracture the working class. In other words, democracy is not \"breaking down.\" It was never meant to serve your interests. As conditions worsen, the true enemy of capital--class solidarity--becomes a greater threat. So a more rigorous form of fracture is necessary, and fascism takes over from \"democracy.\"",

Every \"anti war\" stance held by fresh political faces gets swept away the second they achieve power. Not just because they were faking it, or because they got bought off by the military industrial complex, but because they have been onboarded into the fundamental U.S. project. They have been educated on the real role of the military. It's not American Exceptionalism, hunger for the blood of foreigners, or hot-headed patriotism.

It is variously used by fascists masquerading as communists (e.g. Aleksandr Dugin), fascists masquerading as liberals (e.g. Alexandre del Valle), and liberals masquerading as \"democratic socialists\" (e.g. Alexander Hernandez). https://t.co/jMbpMUUnez The purpose of this myth is to conflate \"far left\" and \"far right\" ideologies in order to simultaneously legitimize fascism and denigrate communism. In the real world, this unity is simply impossible: there is no version of communism that can contain a single particle of fascism. What all those Alexes skip over in their \"analysis\" is the characteristic difference between the national consciousness of oppressed nations and the \"great-nation consciousness\" that defines fascism. National liberation is a key component of communism -- and the enemy of fascism. PFLP's alliance with Palestinian nationalists is not a tactical error, it is a deliberate and immutable part of the struggle for liberation. The oppression faced by Palestinians is through the lens of their national identity, and that cannot be undone without a national movement. It is impossible for those who seek to retain their great-nation status to reckon with this simple truth, because it would require divesting themselves of the material advantages afforded to them by national oppression. Instead, they uphold a mythical \"socialism, absent nations.\" And within that ideological framework, any alliance between Marxists and a fully-conscious movement of oppressed nations must be relegated to the realm of \"distraction from class\" or \"a foolish deal with the devil.\" Meanwhile, they see no devilry at play when they ally with the oppressor national identity. They call themselves \"American socialists\" or \"French socialists\" or \"Russian socialists.\" \n\nIn other words, they are National Socialists.",

        "smushed_text": "No, this isn't \"world war III.\"\n\nThat's kind of the main point of Israel and why it's been so valuable to the US. It allows the empire to contract out its military ventures and avoid the liability of open war.\n\nIncidentally, this is also the reason for US meddling in Ukraine. WWIII would take the form of open war between NATO and a military alliance of its enemies. NATO is explicitly a \"world war-level\" arrangement; its purpose is to set out, in clear terms, the fact that all member states would be engaged in any conflict involving any of them. That goes both ways. It is primarily meant as an overwhelming deterrent to prevent shattering the illusion of invulnerability held by the imperial core. But the pretense would be destroyed if a member state engaged in active war and *didn't* drag the alliance along with it. There's a reason NATO was never officially invoked during the cold war, but in the aftermath of the collapse of the USSR, it quickly mobilized to mop up \"geopolitical messes.\" Fighting an enemy on equal footing *would* mean WWIII. Flexing military hegemony is no issue. NATO is not just a shield, but a wall, past which its members can't easily launch an assault. Volleys of arrows, sure, but not full-scale movement.\n\nFor that, the empire needs military outposts. Enter Israel. Enter Ukraine. Enter Taiwan. The greatest challenges to NATO's hegemony are Russia in Eastern Europe, China in East Asia, and Iran in West Asia. They are considered untouchable under the NATO paradigm -- *direct* war between any of them and NATO would be catastrophic, especially because of nuclear weapons. But war could still be fought by funneling weaponry through a loyal \"third party,\" such as Israel or Ukraine, without needing to drag the entire alliance into a destabilizing conflict. The imperial playbook of browbeating to secure routes and resources could still be followed. This is the context for the US's unflinching support for the genocide in Gaza. A bottomless supply of aid, entirely predicated on sustaining the security of a vital military base. Al Aqsa Flood represented a legitimate threat that needed to be stamped out with overwhelming force. This is also why Ukraine, even after the 2014 coup put it solidly in NATO's camp, was strung along for years and continuously denied membership: it would be useless to the empire if conflict with Russia meant the entire alliance would need to involve itself against a Real Enemy. And now that Israel has found itself up against another Real Enemy -- a move that was determined to also be necessary to prevent its collapse -- the empire finds itself at a crossroads. Israel's usefulness is certainly wearing thin, and the cost of its maintenance is rising. It's extremely unlikely that the US would actively involve itself in this stage of the conflict. If it ever had to, it would all but confirm that its occupation of Palestine is more liability than asset. But ceding that outpost would be a tremendous blow to its hegemony. Instead, we are more likely to see a reprise of the Ukraine strategy: a constant influx of military support toward an intractable stalemate, while the empire hopes for some opportunity to undermine the enemy on another battlefront. Meanwhile, the occupation remains under assault from the rest of the axis of resistance. There is a limit to how wide it can be stretched, even with unlimited US support. And the current US administration seems less and less interested in maintaining the NATO model of hegemony. If this stage of conflict expands, Iran draws more of Israel's fire and causes more damage to its vital infrastructure, and the Palestinian resistance is able to rally and relaunch its assault, we may soon see the US decide to cut its losses, bringing the end of the occupation.",

This is why *I'm* in [other organization that is also fundamentally flawed]!!\"\n\nI got news for you: they're all terrible. The instinct to find the \"best org that can save us\" is puerile. You are not entitled to a ready-made party apparatus, just because you're willing to \"put in the work to change it from within.\" And it's not \"wrecking\" to point out the fatal flaws of ALL of these orgs. I'll be more specific: the central problem with every large \"communist\" or \"socialist\" org in the US is an inability to conceive of the full scope of the project ahead of us -- and an inability to recognize that gap in their conception. This error comes down to \"Americanness.\" The farthest I have ever seen is a recognition that the US *constitution* needs to be replaced. Concessions are often made to the *concept* of decolonization, of \"landback,\" but every org's horizon of a \"socialist future\" still retains the construct of \"The US\" within it. Yankee culture so thoroughly suffuses every corner of these organizations, leading to every other downstream error: belief that revolution is impossible, disbelief in the concept of labor aristocracy, opportunism, denunciation of shared revolutionary history, lack of democracy... ... lack of centralism, chauvinism, haphazard or nonexistent political development, disconnection from the material well-being of the masses, hyper-securitization, under-securitization, membership turnover, stagnant growth, labor/resource shortages, distrust, disunity, and so on. At the end of the day, you simply cannot call yourself \"[X] of America\" and expect to see any movement toward a coherent, unified, powerful, mass-supported party, capable of ending US hegemony. You are giving up the war of position before you even begin to fight it. You cannot reform Americanism out of Americanist orgs.\n\nYou cannot form a *new* organization and proclaim \"This is it, guys! I promise, this time we have The Real Communist Party!\"\n\nYou cannot carry forward \"a good theoretical line\" and expect the movement to coalesce around you. The urge to Join An Org\u2122\ufe0f and hope that it's The Right One, and if it isn't, to Change It From The Inside is coming from a good place: a desire to actually WORK. But the work is being wasted. These orgs do not want to be changed. They are structurally impervious to reform. You think you can fight the riptide of liberalism and keep from being swept under, because you're a strong swimmer. But the best you can hope for is to struggle as hard as you can, just to tread water. No one is stronger than the current.\n\nYou need a boat. How do you build a boat? On dry land.\n\nYou form smaller, local groups. You study together. You feed your community together. You develop together. You convene with other local groups. You build your organizations into solid structures that do not bend in the wind. When we have a fleet of seaworthy vessels, with well-trained crews and a destination in mind, then and only then can we set out onto the water and have a chance of success. You can't skip steps by just jumping into the water. There are no shortcuts to revolution.",

People who aren't even CLOSE to making the decision between spending $60 on a restaurant trip and spending $60 on ingredients and then discarding $50 worth of it. I want to be clear that my family growing up was NOT food insecure. Not like my neighbors then or now. We always had food on the table, because at any point, one or both of my parents was always employed. But there was no way we were EVER going to be casually eating out. We didn't order food and then complain that it was expensive. We bought REAL food -- sensible ingredients that we could afford -- prepared it thriftily, and prioritized finishing leftovers before getting more food. If you have the money for restaurants, you can do that easily. My parents both cooked, because it would have been ridiculous for my mom (the better cook) to do it every day. As soon as my siblings and I were old enough, we shopped, cooked, and cleaned as well. We were taught the value of not wasting money, food, or time. I can barely even imagine how all this looks to people for whom just getting ANY food is an uncertainty. That's over 15% of the US population. Worldwide, it's over 30%. \"Groceries are more expensive than restaurants\" is the most ridiculous, entitled, out of touch, 10%er bullshit.",

Depending on the mode of production in each country, that productive labor can still rely on extractive and exploitative methods, like it does today. That doesn't really affect whether each step in the process is \"productive labor\" or not. @slugwave @yeongno3 Exploited foreign coffee farmers must still be producing at least enough to survive, otherwise the coffee industry would not survive. The commodification of their labor product abstracts the notion, since it might not otherwise be survivable within their home markets. @slugwave @yeongno3 Commodification also means that if individual workers do *not* survive this exploitation, the industry can still manage, as long as there is sufficient replacement for the lost labor. Hence why exploitation of the global south is much more brutal than in \"wealthy\" nations. @slugwave @yeongno3 Because of that extraction, the \"productivity\" can be seen by the capitalist as value beyond what they must compensate farmers to maintain the survival of that labor force. And that value is determined by the *domestic* market, not the market in the exploited region. @slugwave @yeongno3 Meaning that the farmers might *not* be able to survive by farming coffee and exchanging it in their home markets. As exploitative and brutal as this process is, global trade therefore still does increase those workers' productivity as an entire class. @slugwave @yeongno3 Hence why focusing on who is or is not \"productive\" is largely a pointless distraction. It flattens and erases the nuance of the nature of capitalist exploitation. It's being used here by patsocs as a purely aesthetic tool to try and exclude workers they have disdain for.",

Most crucially, the destruction of several key carbon sinks, especially rainforest collapse and the disruption of deep sea carbon sequestration.

Even if the entire global north is prepared to absorb all climate migrants (rather than the much more likely fascist acceleration), doing so will trigger further shifts. Land use will become further intensified, even as agricultural conditions continue to spiral. Deforestation will accelerate, depriving us of yet more carbon sequestration. Monoculture will erode soil and fresh water reserves faster. Energy use to keep up will burn yet more carbon Surrendering 2 degrees of warming almost *guarantees* hitting 3 degrees later on, through these biophysical and social feedback loops.

We produce more than we need to reproduce our labor, but not to our own detriment. @Rocko64_ And those societies which do not evolve into class forms obviously get \"naturally\" outcompeted by those which do.

I think this is the most important thing I've ever written, and I'm glad it resonated with so many people.\n\nUnfortunately, the only thing that's changed since then is that we've learned that COVID is even WORSE.\n\nhttps://t.co/7cUBHzApCc A lot of the claims made in the article were narrative-crafting: a picture drawn from incomplete data. In the past year, far more data has come out, making claims like viral persistence, immune dysfunction, and the infection of every organ system, no longer \"likely,\" but certain. My only regret about this article is that the picture it paints isn't terrifying ENOUGH. I've been decried for \"fear mongering,\" but I actually feel like I equivocated too much in Let Them Eat Plague, out of fear of making predictions that didn't pan out. Others, more courageous than me, have made much stronger predictions. @fitterhappierAJ recently predicted that you NEVER truly clear the virus.\n\nI don't dispute that. That's certainly where the evidence is pointing, even if it hasn't been conclusively demonstrated. That's why I've been consistent in referring to \"the acute stage of COVID.\" The disease is not that initial bout of feeling crappy: it's chronic. If you don't have long COVID, you didn't necessarily dodge a bullet: you might just not have reached that stage of the disease. Yet. I don't care if people call me a fear monger. Be afraid. Wear a mask. Avoid large gatherings. Test regularly. If we do nothing, this will only get worse.",

Namely, those who are *economically reliant* on members of the official Labor Force. People who are too young, too old, too disabled, etc. to work, and for whom the major breadwinner is a part of that ~23%. Or people outside the labor force who have *no one* at all. Leaving the workforce entirely due to disability, childcare, elder care, and various other factors, disproportionately affects lower economic strata, who cannot afford to *hire* caregivers themselves. (This class is, in fact, the same class *being* hired to care for others.) We haven't even begun to talk about the other invisibilized cohorts that are missed by BLS surveys, particularly criminalized populations. Immigrants, prostitutes, drug dealers, and many others who justifiably turn and walk the other way when official surveyors come around. Undocumented immigrants in particular represent a large chunk of the population whose work is extremely precarious, and who are responsible for a disproportionately large number of dependants (given the difficulty of even able-bodied family members being able to find work). All of this leads to an economic situation that is much more dire than is reflected by that 23% figure. 23% of survey-visible providers are the economic foundation of far more than 23% of the population -- and they struggle to do that.\n\nThis is the precariat.",

        "smushed_text": "Rice cookers are a marvel of elegant and straightforward engineering! They take advantage of several different quirks of physics to work consistently and deliver the perfect rice every time, with no effort on the part of the user. \ud83e\uddf5 https://t.co/WLQtU07kqj The first trick in the rice cooker arsenal is latent heat of vaporization. Essentially, in order for a liquid -- in this case water -- to turn into a gas, it needs energy. As the rice cooker heats up the water, the first chunk of heat goes into the water to raise its temperature However, past the boiling point, any *additional* heat being added to it instead goes toward letting molecules escape the liquid as vapor. This means that, under normal conditions, liquid water *cannot* get above 100\u00b0C. If you try to heat it more, you'll just boil it *faster*. This also means that, since the water is sucking up all the heat energy it can from its surroundings, the *entire cooking vessel* will stay at that temperature as well! It'll never get above 100\u00b0C as long as there is still liquid water to soak up the heat and vaporize. The second trick relies on the properties of rice itself. The grains are made up of mostly carbohydrates, arranged into a sort of complex lattice of tightly-bound starch molecules. As they sit in the hot water, their structure loosens up, and water molecules slip into the gaps. The grains soften and expand as they cook, letting more and more water enter until they're full, like little sponges. Past this point, cooking adds more heat that, rather than deforming the \"starch cage\" any more, causes the starches to get *so* soft that the rice gets mushy. Luckily, the bulk of the heat energy is still going toward the vaporization of water. As long as the vapor can escape and take that energy with it, the cooking will largely only progress to a certain point of perfect fluffiness. The next trick is something physicists refer to as an \"MLG trickshot,\" or occasionally \"the Curie point.\"\n\nMagnets get less and less powerful as they heat up, due to what is essentially the individual pieces of the magnet jiggling around and getting disorganized. Above the Curie point, a magnet will lose its ability to attract metals -- metals like, for example, the pot of a rice cooker. When you press \"on\" on your rice cooker, the cool vessel is brought into contact with a magnet, which then holds it directly against the heating element. At this point, a somewhat less impressive physics trick engages, where the electrical circuit driving the heating is only complete while in this position. If you physically lift the pot out of the main body, the heat will turn off. Now that the heat is on, the magnet is attached to a metal pot that is quickly heating up. And remember, if it gets too hot, the magnet will stop working!\n\nLuckily, it won't get too hot, because of -- say it with me! -- latent heat of vaporization \ud83d\ude0a The heating element will continue to pour energy into the cooking vessel, which will get transferred into the water, which then simultaneously transfers some energy to cook the rice and embezzles most of it to vaporize. Everything stays at 100\u00b0C, and the magnet stays in business. Until the water is done, that is. Once all of the water is either absorbed into the starch cage or evaporated away, there is no longer any free water to stall the heating process. From that point on, any extra heat energy will finally start to make things *hotter* than 100\u00b0C. This would ordinarily be bad news for your rice. If it continues to cook at this point, the starch lattice will collapse into mush! The rice at the bottom of the pot will receive the burnt of the heat and instead of mush, will BURN! This is where stove cooking usually goes wrong. Luckily, there's something else that also starts getting hotter, right in the nick of time: the magnet! Almost as soon as the water has finished evaporating, the magnet crosses its Curie point, and stops pulling on the pot. A built in spring pushes the pot up, away from the heat. The cooking circuit is broken, and the secondary circuit comes back on, putting out just enough heat to keep everything warm. A soothing orange LED lights up to inform you that your perfectly cooked rice is being gently cradled at low heat, ready whenever you are. Without any fancy digital programs, thermostats, or even so much as a timer, this humble, dirt cheap miracle device is able to provide a billion people around the globe with an efficient, foolproof method to prepare the most popular food item in the world.",

        "smushed_text": "Addressing this is deceptively complicated, so in this thread, I'll try to go point-by-point.\n\nLet's start with what exactly Marxism is:\n\nMarxism is a way of understanding the world. It doesn't make value judgements, like \"Urbanism is cool\" or \"Indigenous people are yucky.\" https://t.co/iVT0pBsvbq Specifically, Marxism analyzes how societies develop, how classes emerge, and how they interact with each other and the world around them. It does this through the lens of political economy; societies are governed by the things they do -- i.e. their economies. Every society has an economy, including indigenous ones, because every society is made of people, who work to meet their needs. They do this through production -- making stuff that either meets a need (e.g. food, housing) or makes it easier to meet those needs (e.g. tools). Marxism sorts these societies into broad categories based on *how* they do that production. Of particular note is which people do the producing and which people get to decide how the product gets used. For most of human existence, these lined up pretty closely. That is, the product of *your* labor was pretty much yours to decide what to do with it. Obviously, various concepts of social obligation to produce on behalf of others have always been a thing -- we are a social species. Raising children is a pretty universal example. Class societies emerge when there is a divergence between labor and control over the product of that labor. For example, if there is an entire class of slaves who are compelled to produce food on behalf of the enslavers -- who then \"naturally\" have the right to ALL of that food. In such a situation, the enslavers would have a material interest in compelling *more* production, because then they have more stuff. They can use that stuff to get more power -- feed and equip more soldiers, get more slaves, make even *more* more stuff, and repeat. When Marxists talk about \"higher modes of production,\" it's not a statement of morals, but an observation about what demonstrably *happens* in the world. Class societies are able to produce more stuff, which they use to get even more powerful, and make even *more* stuff. All along the way, they use that surplus to develop the means of production, and with that, production accelerates even faster -- as does the need to capture even more territory and subjugate more people and extract more resources to continue that trend. None of this should be particularly controversial -- we can observe these things happening with our own eyes. From these observations, we can begin to craft a political *philosophy*, at which point concepts of \"better\" and \"just\" can finally come into play. The reason we care to do this analysis in the first place is not out of idle navel-gazing, like the philosophers of old. The goal is to not just observe the world, but to *change* it. We want to destroy this exploitation and extraction and environmental degradation. And yes, it is possible to make all of these observations and come to chauvinist conclusions. Certainly, there are a large number of western \"Marxists\" who think \"Well who cares about indigenous people anyway?\" They may say the same about women, queer people, or the global south. They're wrong, of course. Not just \"morally\" wrong, but also in terms of how to successfully *begin*, let alone advance and defend a revolution. Explaining exactly why is a bit beyond the scope of this thread, but suffice to say, there are good reasons they have failed thus far. So no, Marxism -- and Marxists themselves -- are not inherently \"anti-indigenous.\" If indigenous liberation is your primary concern, becoming a decolonial Marxist is the best way to accomplish that. It's also the best way to combat chauvinist trends within Marxism.",

But it's not happening this weekend, just because some people tweet about it, and put up polls about when we should just do it.\n\nHere are the two ways a general strike can actually happen: The first relies on union leadership explicitly calling for a general strike, and members actually following through.\n\nThis would be the product of many years of organizing. The current state of organized labor precludes a top-down announcement for several reasons. First, the current national leadership of unions and federations are opposed to radical change. They are where they are because of their commitment to advancing their own power, which necessarily includes them consorting with other people in power, not challenging them. Second, union density is low, due to decades of deliberate legislative efforts and a union-busting PR cottage industry to combat union formation and expansion. It would take just as long to undo those efforts and rebuild the state of organized labor. So a top-down general strike is years or decades of labor organizing, legislative efforts, and leadership-ousting away. The second way a general strike can realistically happen is organically, starting at the ground level. This would essentially be a wave of local strikes sweeping the nation, which, together, can later be recognized as a general strike. This requires a lot more luck to pull off. You can't really plan this chain of events without a national network of organizers that doesn't currently exist in the capacity it would need for such a short time frame. But luck aside, this path to a general strike is a lot more feasible in the short term. The path forward for individuals is pretty straightforward: organize your workplace, and stay in contact other local workers, particularly unions that already have active membership. If people are making this organizing effort all across the country, conditions may be just right in a couple of locales for a city/county-wide general strike. Maybe not yours, but somewhere. With a strong media effort by the organizers in those areas, it can become regional or national news that a general strike has taken hold. This media attention can make it easier for organizers in other regions to point to a strike as a plausible action. Over the course of several weeks or months, you might--MIGHT--see a national (or even international) movement like we saw with the George Floyd protests. The bandwagon effect is our only hope of this path working to bring us a national general strike. It's still really difficult to organize local level strikes, but it has a much better chance of working than basically just hoping out loud on Twitter. So what is your next step?\n\n1) Form or join a union.\n2) Reach out to members of other local unions\n3) If you have a local DSA chapter, feel them out and see if they're able to help organize workplaces. Not all chapters are willing/able to do this.",

        "smushed_text": "This line of thinking is a particularly alienating outgrowth of what I think of as the \"social role schema.\" That is, the conception of interpersonal relationships as occupying discrete, immutable, non-overlapping functions, each necessary for proper social functioning. https://t.co/YkvUUwUzSe It's the same paradigm that lends weight to social norms like \"the traditional nuclear family\" having special significance, with the husband-wife, father-child, mother-child, and sibling-sibling relationships having specific, prefigured purposes vital to \"stable family life.\" It stems from the phenomenon of reification -- the process by which abstract concepts, like social relations, are \"made into things,\" and assigned intrinsic properties. This is crucial for reinforcing hegemony, causing the social subject to view the status quo as unassailable. In this context of romantic relationships, the social role is being identified as occupying an explicit niche that does not include sharing everything with your partner. It's a prescription of what a romantic relationship ought to be, confining it within specific parameters. In particular, the \"advice\" revolves around deliberately maintaining \"individuality,\" by avoiding letting any given person have access to all your \"secrets,\" and instead portioning out distinct doses among the different roles these people occupy. They talk about having things that are \"just for you,\" because holding them back helps retain an \"erotic charge.\" In this framework, a romantic partner is not so much a person with whom you are sharing your life, and more of a fellow actor with whom you are playing out a scene. You are exhorted to maintain your \"interiority,\" by not sharing too many details of your life with them -- this would break the immersion of the manufactured scene you play. \"Who you are\" is divested from \"what you do.\"\n\nWe call this alienation. This mindset plays out in parallel prescriptions, like the \"advice\" that, past a certain stage of life, you shouldn't be asking friends to give you rides to the airport or help you move -- these are considered services, to be rendered by those who play the role of \"worker.\" Need someone to watch your kids? Hire a babysitter. Need to vent about your frustrations and insecurities? Hire a therapist -- or talk to a priest, a role which, of course, ought to be considered a universal part of social life. Life becomes a series of regimented, discrete market exchanges. People become vending machines from which to purchase particular services. Rather than an interwoven tapestry of communal relations, with redundant strands reinforcing every social need, you live for yourself. The appeal of this is that it allows you to feel like you can control the social environment in which you live. With enough money, moxy, and manipulation, you can get the best of every exchange -- get everything you want from others while giving away as little as possible. You replace the communal courtyard with a fenced-in lawn. You become the little lord of your petty fiefdom. If life ever feels hollow, it's not because you lack a real community -- it's because you haven't purchased the right community tokens from your people-vending machines. Alienation is destructive. You don't have to wall yourself off and jealousy guard some precious \"individual essence\" from those around you. The more of yourself you share with others, the stronger you become -- it's only through social interactions that our selves become real.",

        "smushed_text": "I'll admit, I had a lot of reservations at the outset of this article, but it's more nuanced than it first appears. I still have disagreements that I'll lay out further down in this thread, but overall, the analysis is fairly accurate. https://t.co/uvFHot5esd I initially chafed at the mentioning of the size of DSA, since such a figure is largely irrelevant to the prospects of a project seeking to begin reproducing communists. Size matters during later stages, but we first have to surpass the hurdle of ideological incoherence. I think we can all agree that the millions of members boasted by the Democratic Party do not entice us in the slightest, because we are all aware that the organization's ideological character completely precludes any internal movement.\n\nBut this article doesn't make that error. It is completely clear-eyed about the fact that the bulk of DSA's membership is not some revolutionary or revolutionary-potential mass, waiting to be organized toward productive ends, but rather politically-na\u00efve workers and a dominant contingent of counter-revolutionaries. It acknowledges that the newly-developing consciousness among the bulk of new members is being deliberated stunted by these rightist elements, and that this is something that will continue unabated without the influence of ideologically-developed cadres. It even highlights that it is exactly that nascent political awareness that makes this contingent vulnerable to ideological malpractice, given that the reactionaries preying on them know exactly how to encourage their most misplaced instincts and smother their best ones. Where I disagree is in the characterization of the DSA as essentially being a \"blank slate,\" where internal organization is able to flourish, due to its lack of ideological infrastructure.\n\nYes, the organization makes no *explicit* political demands of its members. However... This seemingly laissez-faire approach is a mirage. Liberalism is hegemonic in the DSA, and its influence on the mass of members goes far beyond organizational programming. It manifests in every interaction a member has with the organization, spreading passively and inexorably. Positions of influence within the org are overwhelmingly held by opportunists and those solidly regimented into liberal ideology. They are national and local leaders, rank-and-file mentors, drinking buddies, etc. all passing around \"common sense\" nuggets of liberal wisdom. Even the most politically advanced members are often mired in unchallenged misconceptions. They're held back by counter-revolutionary pessimism, liberal myths about revolutionary history, or misplaced instincts to negotiate with those they fail to identify as enemies. The article is absolutely correct to assert that isolated individuals cannot hope to make any headway in these conditions. The DSA, even without enforcing operational demands of member ideology, is nevertheless a powerful riptide of liberalism that drags down hapless swimmers. The solution proposed by the article is to first form tight-knit, explicitly revolutionary primary organizations, which can weather the ideological battering. This is also a correct assertion.\n\nHowever, it makes the entire article feel a bit temporally out of place. Forming these organizations has been and still remains THE foremost priority of the movement. Positioning this crucial step as essentially being a precondition for reaching DSA members feels like a conflation, swapping cause and effect in the sequence of revolutionary organizing. We need to build these organizations. We need to root them in Marxist principles. We need them to be able to reproduce revolutionaries. We need them to grow their capacity and scope. Somewhere along the way, we *might* want to bring over DSA members. But that is a side project. DSA is not the locus of revolutionary organizing. It is, at best, a networking opportunity, on the same scale as schmoozing with liberal nonprofits.\n\nOn the whole, I think this article does a fair job demonstrating the dangers of individuals attempting to \"work from the inside.\"",

If you think COVID magically disappeared or stopped being a threat when the bourgeois regime decreed it so, you are beyond gullible and have nothing to add to the movement until you learn some critical analysis. Imagine referring to anyone mentioning climate change as agents of \"CLIMATELPRO.\" Or believing that about the Palestinian genocide or mass incarceration or queer persecution or any of the thousands of other manifestations of the hegemonic structures that reinforce the empire. Of course, I say that as if it's a given that some vague, western \"leftist\" actually cares about any of those things.\n\nI'm not even talking to this guy. I doubt there is any chance of him being convinced that his entire way of life is constructed to keep the world in chains. The sad truth that those of us who actually seek liberation need to contend with is that those with a material investment in the status quo -- even those who believe it's in need of some repair -- also have an interest in skirting around \"troublesome\" analysis. Even under bourgeois cultural hegemony, there are thresholds of acceptable rebelliousness, such as those on display by \"COVID is over! Medicare and unions for all!\" DSA types. Pressure release valves, to allow you to feel radical without the threat of revolutionary mobilization. And there can be no revolution without understanding and tackling these myriad, existential issues. Those who feel the crush of violent repression in their daily lives are more likely to begin the necessary analysis. In the case of COVID, that's typically disabled people. Although in this case, even more so than with other contradictions of the capitalist regime, it is alarmingly easy for someone to *become* part of the cohort which feels the threat most saliently.\n\nI even wrote a little something to help you learn more:\n\nhttps://t.co/SCcNg6WSLi But this isn't even a question of \"how does this affect me personally?\" It's the fact that that question is even being asked that's the problem. It affects *us*. The collective of all the various classes that capitalism actively oppresses, in wildly varying degrees. If you want to consider yourself part of the movement to liberate those classes, you need to be actively rooting out and destroying the liberalism in your mind. You need to be constantly subjecting everything you thought of as \"common sense\" to the harshest inquisition. Otherwise, you are not a part of the revolutionary movement. And if you're not on the side of revolution, you are its enemy. Every excuse you make for maintaining even a sliver of the regime puts you further in the camp of the enemy.\n\nYou are dancing outside Gaza.",

We can characterize this movement as \"progressive\" or \"regressive,\" but the motion happens regardless. The propagation of \"the edge\" isn't random, it's not unidirectional, and it certainly isn't about \"speaking truth to power.\" It acts as a form of social experimentation, channeling and filtering existing social forces behind particular formulations as they emerge. On the scale of whole societies, this is mediated by class: access, distribution, \"stickiness\" (i.e. how persistent the authors of the edge cases are in the public consciousness), and more, are all pushed along by capital and those who hold it. The investment of this capital is a calculation, part of a feedback loop of attention, social penetration, reinvestment, and further propagation. The calculation can be more or less intentional, taking the form of explicit culturecraft (e.g. the \"alt right pipeline\"). In fact, it is often shockingly intentional, *especially* on the regressive edge. There is a vast propaganda apparatus arrayed very deliberately to workshop which particular formulations are most useful for propagating regressive notions in our particular cultural context. While edginess *can* be a way to push society past regressive notions, this is *also* a mechanism of hegemony continuously reinventing itself. The type of \"edginess\" that can be propagated at all necessarily contains elements that prevent it from being a revolutionary departure. That is, \"progressive edginess\" (insofar as it is able to exist in the mainstream consciousness) necessarily takes the form of irreverence toward regressive *aspects* of the hegemonic regime, without truly challenging the foundation on which it rests. For example, comedians poking fun at the \"hypocrisy\" of regressive leaders and policies, such as Trump's approach to immigration, while reifying the underlying logic of \"sensible border policy.\" Theirs is an edginess of *form*, but the content conveys its own fascist tendency. Edginess is always still attached to hegemonic culture. It is useful for advancing particular currents *within* the existing culture, but it is not \"radical.\" In the context of a repressive culture, edginess is best suited to fetishizing repression.",

Other Semitic languages include Arabic, Aramaic, and Amharic. https://t.co/TvfeVPff1K Hebrew emerged as a dialect of the Canaanite languages, along with the now-extinct Ugaritic and Amorite languages, and likely coalesced as a distinct language some time before 3,000 years ago, around the time that the ancient kingdoms of Judah and Samaria started to form. There have been thousands of Hebrew inscriptions found in the region, starting from the late bronze age and up until the Roman era, covering all manner of daily life -- business dealings, legal missives, curses, burial markers, etc. -- not just religious texts. These writings present a clear evolution over time of the ancient Hebrew script, starting with an adaptation of the Phoenician script, which came to be Paleo-Hebrew, and continued to morph into the script of the Hebrew Bible. Over time, Hebrew's usage as a vernacular did start to disappear, supplanted by Aramaic and later Koine Greek. Hebrew became relegated to a liturgical language by 200 CE at the latest, but could easily have stopped being a vernacular much earlier than that. It's not like acknowledging the existence of an ancient people, who had distinct and evolving cultures, languages, histories, and political systems is some sort of betrayal of the cause of Palestinian liberation. This isn't about ancient history -- that's the *Zionist* obsession. The problem with Zionism is not that they're \"lying,\" and don't actually have some ancestral, metaphysical tie to the land. The point is that that framing is ridiculous on its face, and should be discarded outright. Also, I'm not even sure what the alternate hypothesis would be to the concept of Hebrew having once been an actual language. Is the idea that, 3,000 years ago, some people decided to invent a language out of nothing, purely to write a holy book? That doesn't even make sense.",

        "smushed_text": "Railing against \"intersectionality\" and \"postmodernism,\" by positioning them against \"blue collar workers,\" for whom we must \"become a better option than Democrats.\"\n\nThese are the shibboleths of a descent into tailist chauvinism. https://t.co/1wNGH94f7e Terms like \"postmodernism\" are not rigorously defined, and instead are assigned vague and infinitely flexible vibes, allowing them to be slotted into any discussion as an unassailable recrimination against an ideological opponent. Or, usefully, against a strawman \"other.\" The strategy of right deviationists is to allude to an idealistic \"true working class,\" one which is not only unconcerned with, but actively *antagonistic* toward progressive causes, and to exhort \"true revolutionaries\" to divest from pluralism in the name of winning them over. Contrasted with left deviation, which mistakes non-antagonistic contradictions for antagonistic ones, right deviation presents antagonistic contradictions as being non-antagonistic. Chauvinism being the major one. Put simply, they think ideological enemies of revolution are allies, and demand to ostracize allies in the name of getting them on board. They don't come out of the gate saying this, or even necessarily *believing* it, but that is always where this form of idealism ends up. Whether in the form of trying to placate \"winnable liberals\" by toning down rhetoric -- and then eventually sidelining revolutionary priorities -- or in the form of being \"anti-woke\" to endear yourself to \"the heartland,\" the end product is the same: you abandon revolution. It is impossible to \"sneak\" a revolutionary line into your dealings with the masses. You will never frogboil liberals of any stripe, whether conservative or progressive, into communists. You will only ever find *yourself* shifting inexorably toward the right to meet them. This happens because your \"organization\" (to the extent it exists) operates on the basis of its membership. No matter how anti-democratic you intend to be, if it doesn't reflect its membership, the members leave. If you purport to hold liberal ideals, you cultivate liberalism. Because liberalism is hegemonic, there is always an unlimited supply of fresh liberals to enter into your \"movement\" without having counter-revolutionary attitudes challenged. You are not filtering for a willingness to radicalize, you are pandering to what *already exists*. Your \"organization\" acts as a landing strip for regressivism -- the dominant trend of our society. Because the people who arrive are not wet clay to mold to your will, they bring their priorities with them, and those priorities reflect the contradictions of the masses at large. The masses are complicated. Their attitudes are eclectic, constructed from the influences of a diverse range of hegemonic and counter-hegemonic currents. The particulars of their material interests are highly contextual and deliberately fragmented by the capitalist regime. Although Marxists ought to recognize the unifying elements that can be used to tie all oppressed peoples together into one struggle, we cannot simply ignore the *material* basis for the latent regressivism that the superstructure is designed to reinforce. That basis, by the way, is not some mythologized \"economic anxiety\" that transmutes the \"white working class\" into misguided bigots to cope with their own poverty. Quite the opposite. The social system is designed to tie their material interests to the well-being of the regime. Attempting to court this mythologue requires you to *find* them. And in your search for \"socially conservative dudes who just want to keep a roof over their heads,\" you will come up short. Instead, you will be forced to expand your criteria of \"economic anxiety.\" You *will* find plenty of that archetypal \"economy-focused, but tired of intersectionality\" among the labor aristocracy, petty bourgeois, law enforcement, and so on. Your search necessarily becomes filtered more by bigotry itself, and less by economic precarity. This is a consequence of a simple fact about the shape of our society: the most socially marginalized are also the most *economically* marginalized. The purveyors of \"intersectionality\" who fail to adequately unite the theory through the lens of class still get that part right. In fact, if your political project is *actually* starting from a place of addressing economic precarity, and you are truly organizing from the bottom, you will quickly find yourself working with a section of the masses that looks a whole lot like the \"intersectional\" model. This is why, no matter the actual political priorities of the people saying it -- earnest but misguided radical, callous grifter, reactionary hoping to launder their shit -- the rhetoric of \"blue collar vs. intersectional\" is always a bad sign.\n\nI respectfully urge recalibration.",

Fascism is ascendant, trans people are just the most effective crack in the (very recent and very fragile) rise in queer \"acceptance.\" You are a fool if you can't see the existing and growing expansion of that crack to encompass all queerness. https://t.co/DS8D4lUHIw Liberal \"acceptance\" movements are facile, vulnerable to fascist organizing, and do not meaningfully alter the cultural, economic, or political relations that maintain the bourgeois hegemony that keeps us oppressed. We don't need \"acceptance,\" we need liberation. Political liberation. Our goal is not to find some way to assimilate into bourgeois culture, which is vehemently opposed to anything that challenges its hegemony, reproduced as it is through the patriarchal family. We can't win this fight through good PR and behaving \"appropriately,\" because at the core of queerness is the notion that the bourgeois family is not the be-all and end-all of familial relations. Our mere existence is a direct threat to the reproductive cell of bourgeois culture. \"Appropriate\" means imitating, as best as possible, the bourgeois cultural notion of family. Gender roles, as much as they evolve, are still a critical ingredient in that. Subverting the notion that there is an immutable \"essence\" to gender is anathema to this culture. The only \"good PR\" gay liberals were able to accomplish is convincing certain elements of the hegemony that gay people can still have monogamous, nuclear families, with all the same social relations involved. The kids, the houses, the consumption, the reproduction of the culture. Hence the belief that marriage equality was the finish line. That is weak. It's not enough assimilation for certain tendencies, and it is only \"liberation\" for those with the economic and social cache to pull it off. It can and will be ripped away in an instant. It's the exact same pattern we've seen throughout history. Jews in Europe thought they were doing a good job of assimilating. Many attained the rank of successful capitalists. They were deep, lovingly accepted parts of their communities. By \"lovingly accepted,\" obviously I don't mean to imply that antisemitism disappeared. Merely that certain elements of \"civilized society\" saw Jews as just another aspect of the pluralistic liberal society they hoped would maintain hegemony perpetually. Many of them viewed their more culturally distinct counterparts as being \"less appropriate,\" and unwilling to act in a way that the broader society could accommodate. But as it turned out, fascism cannot accommodate *anyone* outside their view of a hegemonic culture. They felt (correctly) that repression and persecution were powerful avenues for growing revolutionary sentiment. Tolerance, to the extent possible within a society built on a very particular set of hierarchical norms, was a useful tool -- until \"to the extent possible\" faded. The more \"inoffensive\" Jews saw their wealth stripped away. They were persecuted in exactly the same way (except those with the wealth and connections to actively collaborate with the fascists in the early stages, including Zionists). Antisemitism bubbled under the surface, particularly among the sectors of society that had been trained for centuries to view themselves as culturally distinct from the essential other -- Jews, foreigners, queer people, etc. Meanwhile, economic conditions deteriorated. None of us are made safe by ceding liberation in favor of acceptance, because liberal acceptance is conditional. Grow the fuck up. Protect yourself and your community. Build revolutionary organizations that can withstand the onslaught of fascism that we are experiencing RIGHT NOW As the material standing of the working class declined, revolutionary sentiment grew, and the ruling class had to fall back on the same old tricks. The \"unifying\" ideology of ultranationalism. Papering over the contradictions of class through a mythical construct of the nation. So deeply engrained were these notions of the nation as essential, of natural gender and family roles, of racial superiority, that they found purchase in the rise of fascism. Those \"tolerant,\" \"civilized\" people found themselves asking \"Who *really* belongs in our civilization?\" We see this being reproduced *right now*. This is not a game. This is not a PR problem. This is not an \"exchange of ideas,\" and there is no compromise the fascists are willing to make. They want us to not exist.",

Rather, this letter and the divestment it proclaims is emblematic of the sinister rhetorical and economic tools of revanchist fascist organizing. Those with extant social, political, and economic power naturally use that power to reinforce the social relations that empower them. They perceive their preeminence as natural, moral, and unshakeable. When they detect even a whiff of mobilization against that hegemonic rule, whether in the form of liberation movements or rival bourgeois camps, they (correctly) recognize that their power is not unassailable. And so, they become more aggressive in using their economic and social heft to punish dissent. They don't just whine about how unfair it is that they are being challenged: they withdraw funds, they launch media campaigns, they fund revanchist political movements. They even employ outright political violence. One of the primary avenues for this is, of course, police action: claims of disrupting the peace, danger to property, or targeted enforcement of petty crimes. They may or may not also directly recruit extrajudicial violence. The funding of terrorist organizations by bourgeois revanchists is often more subtle, and less common in the modern iteration of fascism. However, they have found a much better, more \"respectable\" way of accomplishing this task, through the funding of \"education\" efforts. The revanchists have crafted a mind-bogglingly vast network of radicalization outlets, from Prager U to Daily Wire to various think tanks to non-profits to \"independent\" online influencers. All of these are oriented toward fostering fascist political mobilization. The reason the Wexner Foundation and several other capitalists have called for the naming of the students who signed onto the anti-zionist letter is to turn them into \"legitimate targets.\" These students would be targeted for harassment, economic harm, and physical violence. It's not that they are mere hypocrites, unable to see that \"diversity of perspectives\" goes both ways. It's that they don't want diversity -- they want to maintain their hegemony. And they enforce it with terror. Economic, political, and yes, even physical terror.",

Although the broader working class is fed a diet of hegemonic liberalism, they have not constructed an intentional political project which reifies it. https://t.co/IE3DBAFif6 It's the difference between trying to teach a random person about heliocentrism and trying to convince an entire college of the Ptolemeic system that their model is flawed. They believe they have studied correctly and found The Truth, and that you are a crank. You could perhaps peel off a DSA-er or two in isolation, but the organization as a whole is not some ideological blank slate, as it might appear. It has a potent, hegemonic culture that drags its members into liberalism for the sake of \"unity.\" It preaches high-minded ideals of \"democracy\" and \"open debate,\" but uses methods that toggle between social pressure and \"hypocritical\" censure to quash divergence from the liberal mindset. Many a radical have found themselves fuming at the apparent contradiction, where the more radical aims they *know* should be pursued keep getting marginalized. \"Democratic debate\" somehow doesn't seem to be elevating correct ideas -- just hegemonic ones. That's the flaw of \"petty democracy.\" If people are not educated, or they are educated in a counter-revolutionary way, their democratic will reflects only the liberal backdrop in which they began their political journey. They then democratically elect to maintain that liberalism. This paradox is, of course, unseated by material interest. Among oppressed peoples, the need for radicalization constantly becomes more pressing. People who are barely struggling to survive, whose class instincts place them in direct opposition to the liberal status quo. Contrast this with DSA, which caters primarily to people whose class instincts line up with the liberal order (whether they realize it or not), and attempts to \"radicalize\" them into fighting for a softer, more equitable imperialism. The horizon for radicalism is truncated. Class instincts CAN be overcome, of course. The petty bourgeoisie, when faced with the looming threat of proletarianization, can choose to either entrench themselves further into protecting the extractive system, or they can commit class suicide, and be of service to revolution. The same is true for any oppressor-oppressed class relation, including the modern labor aristocracy. It's a particularly prominent dynamic among those being nudged toward the precipice of class failure, such as the imperial worker whose wages cannot keep pace with inflation. The role of the so-called \"organized left\" is to capture those people and convince them to fight to *prop up* the system driving them to the brink. To fight for wage increases and expanded social programs, to run the treadmill faster, and grind the imperial subject to grist. This is not an environment in which true radicalization can ever take place. You are fighting to convince people of tactics that run counter to the actual project for which the organization is built. They will not be convinced; they would need to *abandon* that project. If they will ever be convinced of anything, it will be in the form of joining an organization with an explicitly revolutionary framework, built by those who are already struggling to survive, and have no allegiance to or fear of the liberal regime.",

        "smushed_text": "I always find the relationship between scientific and colloquial terminology fascinating. It's a dialectical process, where people naturally develop language to describe concepts as they come up, and scientists use language to eliminate ambiguity. These processes simultaneously inform each other and exist in constant tension, because both approach a similar challenge -- communication -- from distinct perspectives. It's the dialectic of spontaneous fulfillment of organic need vs constructed, systematic synthesis. They cannot be disentangled. The need to systematize does not exist without the social backdrop of engagement with the concepts being systematically studied. That engagement is shaped by an increasing mainstreaming of a systematic conception of those concepts. The fundamental feature of language is mutual intelligibility. That is, a particular term is exactly as useful as it is able to bring both speaker and listener together in agreement about what they're talking about about, ideally as efficiently and unambiguously as possible. \"Natural\" languages \"spontaneously' develop to find that balance of being specific without being too encumbered with unnecessarily explicit terminology. If a shorter phrase can be taken to *imply* information, that's good enough, even if it introduces ambiguity. Whereas scientific language, thanks to its tight context, is free to prioritize specificity. Without the need to append lengthy explanations to highly specific terms, communication remains efficient without needing to imply anything -- as long as you're familiar with the jargon. The tension comes in when we have a long-standing term for a broad concept, like \"fish,\" and when we analyze it, we notice that we are applying it to multiple different things with only surface-level similarities, like \"lives in the water.\" When trying to systematically define these terms, we come up against irreconcilable contradictions. Definitions begin to require formulations like \"Here is a list of features common to [X], but not required for it, and some non-[X] things can also have some of these features.\" Even concepts we take for granted, like \"life\" become vague under sufficient scrutiny, and have to be defined within this \"hallmarks of [X]\" paradigm. Over-defining just leads to confusion, because at their root, all definitions are really fueled by \"I'll know it when I see it.\" The reason I bring this up isn't just academic navel-gazing. The practicalities of what language we use and how we use it are critical to movement-building. Being able to \"meet the masses where they are\" isn't just about using the same slang as them or \"dumbing things down.\" It's about understanding the dialectic between *specific* and *implicit* meaning and using it to build that mutual intelligibility. It's impossible to synthesize some very important revolutionary concepts without being able to express them linguistically. The sheer breadth and depth of analysis we do as Marxists requires us to build up a vocabulary that encapsulates those concepts with enough specificity to discuss and further develop them. But in doing so, we generate an archive of uninviting jargon. We necessarily use terms that already have overlap in colloquial speech, injecting our own specificity to them for *our* use. We can't then expect the average people to automatically know those specific uses when presented in an unfamiliar context. Those more colloquial uses -- for example, nation -- aren't *wrong*, they're just being used in a less specific context. And being mindful of that means we often need to be more explicit in explaining how we're using these terms. Defining everything you say feels cumbersome and unnatural, because that's not how we usually use language. It can quickly become boring and confusing, especially when these definitions are presented all at once to someone with *no* familiarity. But you know what's even *more* uninviting? Taking definitions for granted and neglecting all the other associations your audience may have with those words. The more enmeshed you become in the \"academic\" sphere of Marxism, the easier it is to forget the vagaries of language. This is one reason simply presenting theses in text is such a hard sell. It's not just that \"no one wants to read anymore,\" it's that the way we naturally learn language relies on more nuance than strictly carving definitions into stone. It needs to be a *conversation*. When you're speaking directly with someone, you can use tone, pitch, body language, pauses, emphasis, repetition, and so on, much more effectively. You can check for understanding, see their eyes glaze over when you ramble, hear their questions, clarify on the spot, etc. When that's not possible, and writing these treatises actually is necessary, try to treat them like you would a conversation. Anticipate the sources of confusion, imagine those micro-signals, adjust your tone as you go. And of course, wherever possible, field comments and absorb critique. Don't just habitually reject \"disagreement\" as obstinacy -- treat it as a disconnect in the respective expectations around terminology between you and your intended audience. Try to bridge the gap.",

The goal is to teach kids not to simply memorize abstract, disconnected mathematical \"facts,\" like a parrot reciting \"Twelve minus three equals nine!\" but to actually understand the operations. https://t.co/J6pgScYucB The purpose of this exercise is to reflexively see numbers as composed of their parts, existing in relation to each other, allowing them to \"move\" them freely and transform them. \"3\" is not just a static object, but a product of the addition of 1 and 2, reversible at will. 12 is not just an object: among other things, it's 10 + 2. 12 - 2 is 10, so 12 - 2 - 1 is 10 - 1 which is 9. Since 3 is 2 + 1, 12 - 3 is the same as 12 - 2 (which is 10) and then another - 1. If that sounds complicated, it's because you're unaware that that's exactly what your brain is automatically doing, once you've become practiced in math. These exercises aren't about forcing kids to go through extraneous steps, it's about reinforcing those mental pathways. If practiced correctly, these steps get integrated seamlessly into a growing number of operations, making simple math as inconsequential as language or reflexive motor function, and more complex math suddenly becomes *achievable*.

        "smushed_text": "I tend to tweet about a lot of serious stuff. How about some fun, uncontroversial, totally apolitical science?\n\nLet's talk about the kingdoms of life!\n\nModern phylogeny focuses on the evolutionary history of organisms, rather than their apparent traits. https://t.co/a9uSthcaXr All living things on Earth evolved from a single common ancestor. Technically, you are 1,000th, 1 millionth, or 1 trillionth cousins with every human, every dog, every tree, and every one of the billions of bacteria you kill every morning when you brush your teeth! https://t.co/deSXkoUYoV Scientists tend to group life into 3 kingdoms: bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. We have a lot of evidence to suggest that this latter category (which includes all animals, plants, and fungi) is just a special kind of archaea that swallowed mitochondria without digesting them! https://t.co/wQpCGG2LXw This is called endosymbiosis: a symbiotic relationship between different species, one of which is inside the other. Think of our gut bacteria; they digest food we can't, giving us access to more nutrients, and they get a constant supply of that food, courtesy of their giant host! https://t.co/kldNTh2k5u Since mitochondria are likely descended from bacteria, this would mean that our kingdom is the result of the union between the two other kingdoms! \n\nPlants likely even went one step farther and later swallowed *another* bacteria, which gave them the ability to photosynthesize! https://t.co/PO9f7J2cG9 The divergence of plants from other eukaryota is estimated to have happened 1.5-1.8 billion years ago. About 1-1.2 billion years ago, fungi and animals started to diverge. Yes, you're more closely related to a mushroom than a tree! We have a lot in common with our fungal cousins. Even before plants gained photosynthesis, they stored their carbohydrate energy in the form of starch, while fungi/animal ancestors used glycogen. This might sound trivial, but it's a huge difference! Starch is more rigid, so glycogen-users tend to be more flexible and mobile. https://t.co/STnhYZtMoB Plants adapted their starch energy storage to evolve cellulose, which is *really* rigid, to form their protective cell walls. Fungi and animals adapted glycogen to form chitin--our own cellular armor. Many animals (including mammals) have since evolved *away* the use of chitin. https://t.co/sYnfia1y1V Everything we've talked about so far has been *single-celled* life. It's hard to pin down when true multicellular life emerged, but it's pretty clear that all three branches of eukaryotes--and some bacteria and archaea--evolved multicellularity *independently*! It's not as hard as you might think to make the leap from single-celled to multi-celled organisms. Unicellular organisms have formed stuck-together blobs called colonies for billions of years. The molecular prerequisites for shifting to multicellularity were already there. https://t.co/Uswk7aCw3J One striking example is the algal genus volvox. It forms blobs that have an outer layer responsible for obtaining nutrients for the \"colony,\" and inner cells whose only job is to reproduce. This is true multicellularity, because the outer cells cannot reproduce on their own. https://t.co/C1fwOBNQZo As far as we can tell, multicellular life emerged independently DOZENS of times in eukaryotes, although all animals seem to be descended from one multicellular ancestor.\n\nWe don't know what the first animal was, but the earliest animal fossils we have are likely sponges. https://t.co/VBJIf1ZNmN Obviously, as humans, we care a lot about the evolution of animals, so I might make a specific thread on animal evolution later. Needless to say, a lot has happened to animals in the past 700-600 million years, although we still represent only 0.4% of all biomass on Earth! https://t.co/eYEfjd7AIh The history of life on Earth is messy and still not fully-understood. But it's really interesting to think about where we came from and what changes led to us being here!\n\n\u201cFor a biologist the alternative to thinking in evolutionary terms is not to think at all.\u201d\n-Peter Medawar https://t.co/Ssoaoswfua",

        "smushed_text": "The Energy Paradox\n\nWe all know you need energy to survive. Food contains macromolecules -- proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates -- that have chemical energy, which we measure as calories. Your cells break down these molecules, using the energy to perform cellular processes. Everything from DNA replication to muscle contraction to the synthesis of all the protein machines that perform these processes requires calories. Every living thing uses ATP for these energy transactions, but there are a number of ways to get the energy to create ATP. Eukaryotes, including all plants, fungi, and animals, have mitochondria, which use a process called aerobic respiration. \"Aerobic\" meaning \"in the presence of oxygen,\" because the steps to release energy from food molecules and create ATP use oxygen to \"burn\" the molecules. This process is fundamental to all multicellular life. Even plants, which use photosynthesis to assemble their own food molecules (releasing oxygen as they go), still have to reverse that process through aerobic respiration to create ATP. The crux of what I call the \"energy paradox\" is as follows: although we fundamentally need those calories for our survival, the very process of metabolizing those food molecules is *intrinsically harmful* to cells, accelerates aging, and contributes significantly to mortality. We've known for decades that lab rats allowed to eat as much as they want live substantially shorter lives than rats with a restricted diet. This effect on *average* lifespan is somewhat mitigated by exercise and reduction in body mass, but notably, not their *maximum* lifespan. In other words, the decline in maximum lifespan is not an effect of obesity, but a direct function of caloric intake. Animals on restricted calorie diets live longer, regardless of their level of activity.\n\n(To a point, obviously. Starvation still kills you.) Studies that compared rats on restricted calorie diets, who either exercised or received even fewer calories, such that their body masses stayed the same, found no difference in their lifespans. Whether they exercised or not, they lived longer than unrestricted counterparts. https://t.co/WVTeeHCmj8 So what does this mean? Why does eating less extend lifespan, even in sedentary animals? There are a number of hypotheses.\n\nOne is the idea that aerobic respiration results in the creation of reactive oxygen species -- oxygen-containing molecules which react with other molecules. Molecules such as the proteins, lipids, and especially DNA that your cells need to function. Oxygen is a very reactive element, which is why it's useful for reacting with food molecules to release energy. ROS's are produced as a byproduct of respiration and wreak havoc on cells. They react with and break apart DNA, causing damage that can't always be repaired. If allowed to go on unchecked, this will eventually lead to an accumulation of mutations that can cause cells to become cancerous. To deal with this, cells use antioxidants, which \"soak up\" ROS's. But antioxidants aren't perfect, so some ROS's will still break through that first line of defense, at an increasing rate as more food gets metabolized. The second line of defense is DNA damage repair, which, again, is not perfect. Eventually, the damage would outpace repair. The next line of defense isn't about protecting the cell itself, but the whole organism. To head off the possibility of a cell turning cancerous, cells undergo apoptosis -- programmed cell death. ROS's themselves are actually used as one of the signals to initiate apoptosis. (This is handy, because the thing causing the problem triggers the solution to the problem. This is a common thing across a whole bunch of other biological processes, such as pieces of pathogens triggering the immune responses to those pathogens.) Obviously, there are a bunch of other things that can cause cells to become so damaged that they might become a problem, and many other pathways to trigger apoptosis. But again, these regulatory checkpoints aren't perfect, which is why, given enough time, you will develop cancer. Cancer is such a huge concern for multicellular organisms that it's practically our bodies' chief preoccupation. Our cells would do just about anything to prevent cancer, including killing themselves and each other. But one thing they simply cannot do is stop consuming calories. Over the course of your life, every calorie you consume to survive generates more and more ROS's. Each line of defense gets slowly overwhelmed over time. Apoptosis has to increase to compensate. Eventually, cell death starts to outpace the growth of new cells to replace them. This is one of the primary ways in which aging occurs. Wrinkles form as the collagen- and elastin-producing cells in your dermis thin out. Bones get weaker as osteoblasts age out. Muscles shrink, your immune system gets depleted, and whole organs eventually shut down. Obviously, there are a lot of other factors at play in aging, cancer, metabolism, and mortality. There are many hypotheses about the relationship between caloric intake and lifespan. The oxidative damage model is my favorite, but it still presents a lot of questions. Chief among them is the fact that, as mentioned, *every* eukaryote uses aerobic respiration for energy. If it's so hazardous, and such a universal problem, how can evolutionary solutions to it be so rare?\n\nOne answer is, of course, that the status quo is good *enough*. Oxidative damage accumulates over a long period of time. So long as organisms can survive it long enough to reproduce, there's no real selective pressure that would give organisms a relative advantage for being able to prevent it. This would be true for any other cause of aging. An answer more specific to ROS's is that signaling I mentioned earlier. ROS signaling is used for a lot more than just triggering apoptosis, and it is an incredibly ancient toolkit across all multicellular life. Tampering with ROS's too much impairs development and cell growth. So we're kind of stuck with it. This dialectical tension between the acquisition of energy and the damage wrought by its acquisition is largely inescapable. We can't resolve the fundamental contradiction without running afoul of the systems built up around that tension. There might be some perfect balance of cellular mechanisms that would maintain those signaling pathways, while preventing or unerringly repairing the collateral damage. But evolution is stupid, and cannot plan ahead. Maybe someday, we intelligent beings can.",

The thesis of Zionism -&gt; \"White\" -&gt; facile protection from racialization should not at all be taken as an *endorsement*. Quite the opposite. Compradors harm the working class of their *own* nation, even while they tout nationalism. Jews are incredibly vulnerable, and we need to recognize that the \"protection\" offered by allying with white supremacy is poisonous. And obviously, even ignoring the damage done to Jews by Zionism, it's reprehensible to oppress others to protect yourself.

        "smushed_text": "The thing about Will's \"media bias and TikTok teens\" hypothesis -- besides it being a rehashing of the same tired arguments that have around longer than any of us -- is that it's actually half true. There IS considerable negative sentiment towards the economy on social media. He actually agrees with me: he just thinks this means that the Democrats need to find ways to reassert hegemony, while I think the building of proletarian culture is an unstoppable rising tide that will, one way or another, overwhelm bourgeois hegemony.\n\nhttps://t.co/sTmyuvoD7O Where it falls apart is in the second part of his model: that this negativity is the result of craven opportunism, because \"negativity sells.\"\n\nThe negativity bias is a real, observable phenomenon, with replicable data backing it up, and it extends far beyond media consumption. The key question to ask, then, is WHY we have a bias towards negativity. Why are our perceptions more easily colored by negative facts than positive ones?\n\nA corollary question is: why is there still so much media cheerleading around clearly negative things? Why has coverage of the pandemic been so hegemonic in its positivity, despite the fact that COVID remains the third leading cause of death? Why has the perception that COVID is no big deal been so readily accepted by the vast majority of the population? Why do news outlets constantly highlight \"progress\" on climate change, when the situation has only ever gotten worse? Why do they use framing like \"The IRA is the most ambitious climate action ever,\" when it legislates the annual leasing of 62 million acres for fossil fuel use? Why do they always dig for the same facile numbers Will pulls out to describe the \"optimistic economy,\" instead of interviewing people who can't keep their heads above water? Why don't they talk about grotesque and growing wealth inequality, when such framing boosts ratings? We can answer all these questions by understanding the mechanics of cultural hegemony. This is the way in which the interests of the ruling class of a society come to dominate social perceptions and norms, through the use of the myriad institutions at their command. The primary aim of these ideological actors is to present every base element of the status quo as \"natural.\" This permeates so thoroughly through the culture that it reaches places you don't even perceive as being open to culture-crafting, let alone the result of it. Such concepts as law, media, education, the family, democracy, gender, the nation, religion, and more are all outgrowths of the dominant ideology. In our society, these are all rooted in bourgeois norms -- those that naturalize the rule of the capitalist class. They're SO naturalized that you may not even be able to grasp that they're intentionally constructed in the first place. Like a fish buffeted by geophysical forces that shape ocean climate, without a conception of the water around them as anything other than \"the way things are.\" The laws were written by the bourgeoisie. The economic relations they protect were forged by the bourgeoisie. Respect for and knowledge of the norms were taught in bourgeois schools, capital controls the disbursement of media that upholds it, and so on. Everything is filtered through the lens of these \"natural\" norms and values. Violence is waged to maintain it, villains are made of those who oppose it, personal success is predicated on allegiance to it. \"Diversity\" is permitted only as far as it can be managed within hegemony. Getting back to the role of social media and the negativity bias, we start to reckon with the primary countervailing force combatting bourgeois cultural hegemony: proletarian culture. Wherever there are oppressed peoples and classes, counter-cultures naturally emerge. The \"counter\" in these cultures can be deliberately constructed in active rejection of the dominant culture (think punk, think hippie), or they can simply be *existing* cultures that refuse to bow to the violence of imperialism (think Indigenous, think Black). Some countercultures, especially those built on facile notions of \"rebellion,\" are eventually subsumed by hegemony. The aesthetic, if not rooted in material struggle, can easily be adapted into a form that is inoffensive to the dominant class. But they keep popping up. The cultural elements that present the most challenge to the notion of a natural bourgeois rule -- typically by directly contradicting particular norms, such as the dominance of the settler population or the immutability of gender -- cannot be so easily defanged and subsumed. They might try to appropriate aesthetics, they might tokenize, they might pass toothless resolutions of recognition. But they can't erase the material roots that spawned those more radical cultural currents without upending their own economic project. Over time, all currents of this emerging proletarian culture come to be dominated more and more by those elements which could not be subsumed or destroyed: those most rooted in material struggle against material oppression. The cultural positioning coalesces into maneuvering. We don't just make our voices heard to each other, seeding cultural cross-pollination through asserting our existence: we *educate* each other. We study. We practice. We organize. These threads of oppressed cultures transition from negative to positive. The so-called \"negativity bias\" observed by liberals, much to their consternation, is driven not by some innate human pessimism, but by a steadily rising consciousness. We are becoming less content with \"that's just the way things are.\" It is harder to buy us off. The negativity is not a symptom of a society drowning in algorithms and a desire to be miserable at all costs. It is the final phase of the evolution of a cohesive proletarian culture before it builds its party and begins its march to war: a war that it will win.",

Are people seriously still regurgitating the same tired anticommunist tropes that have been tried for over a century?? https://t.co/9P3xkqd6V7 Marxists are principled. We are materialists. We study the world through the lens of science, history, and dialectical analysis. That means our theory is necessarily separate from any metaphysical worldview. That doesn't mean we detest or disdain those who hold those views. In fact, we intentionally STUDY the deep, multifaceted role of faith in society. Whether a particular individual or group happens to be religious -- or even primarily motivated by religion -- is not a matter of scorn for a Marxist. We always judge based on social context. People often cite Marx saying \"religion is the opiate of the masses,\" as a way of pointing to the supposed derision Marxists have for religion. But they leave out the full context of that quote: he also calls it \"the heart of a heartless world, the soul of soulless conditions.\" Religion can of course be used as a placating force to convince people that their place in an oppressive social hierarchy is a natural, divinely-ordained condition, unchangeable, irrevocable. But it can also be a balm, or even a motivator toward justice. More than anything, Marxists are revolutionaries. We are PRACTICAL, not idealists. Believing that we can somehow eradicate religious belief with FACTS and LOGIC is idealistic nonsense and counterproductive. And no serious revolutionary is even close to attempting that. Marxist *organizations* absolutely must be fully secular. That doesn't mean we can't work with religious organizations that align with our goals. It doesn't even mean individual Marxists within our organizations can't have their own private faith. It just means *we* don't use religion, faith, or any other metaphysical beliefs as organizing tools. And yes, we should challenge our fellow Marxists when they present faith as integral to revolution -- just as much as we should challenge Marxists who call faith disqualifying. The goal is liberation for ALL oppressed peoples: all oppressed nations, all oppressed classes, all faiths -- including none at all. That's why secularism is so important. But it's also why outright antagonism is harmful. In summation, stop acting like Marxists are petulant \"Reddit atheists\" for espousing a worldview rooted in secularism. And if you, like myself, are an atheist, stop acting like religious people are idiot children for trying to find some hope while they struggle for liberation. Hope is a critical component of revolution. I derive my hope solely from my study of history, a scientific understanding of social forces, and a deep optimism in our inevitable success. Who are we to deride a fellow revolutionary's source of hope?

It's also why we don't resort to benevolent lies, like \"mask for opsec purposes!\" or \"mask for inclusivity!\" https://t.co/d8V2uiOuWc When you tell people that masks are for opsec, you risk them deciding they're willing to risk it, because they want to be \"loud and proud.\" When you tell them masks are for making actions accessible, you risk them treating masks as a symbol, rather than a crucial safety measure. When your method of convincing people to take COVID precautions is to appeal to their sense of justice, you are unwittingly reinforcing dichotomous thinking, in which people mentally separate the \"activism\" side of their life from the \"mundane\" sphere. You are putting masks into the activism sphere, along with all the other behaviors that they wouldn't exhibit at work or the grocery store. You can fume over the lack of consistency all you like, you can remind people that \"disability justice\" has to be an everywhere thing, etc. But it doesn't change the fundamental contradiction at play, which is that, in the absence of full-blown revolution, people naturally approach different situations from different frames of mind. No one can \"live the revolution\" if there isn't a revolution to live. This is usually a good thing: it keeps mundane matters out of activism (e.g. no using encampments as your dating pool) and keeps activism out of hostile areas of \"mundane\" life (e.g. there is usually nothing to be gained from screaming at your boss for being a capitalist shill.) But in this case, it prevents people from realizing the importance of masking *everywhere*, not just for \"justice\" reasons, but for self-protection, and for the overall health of *everyone*. COVID safety needs to be taught as being mundane, automatic, obvious. This is really really hard to do against the backdrop of a society that has been completely inured to the omnipresent threat of COVID. Even something as simple as going to the store in a mask *is* taking a stand, so it *feels* very non-mundane. Trying to overcome that by steering into the skid, and convincing people that it very much is an extraordinary act -- just one they should do anyway -- fails to bridge the cognitive gap and lower the social barrier to masking, i.e. the reflexive mirroring of others' behavior. This isn't a question of right and wrong, consistency, or ideological purity. This is a question of getting people to consistently do something that society tells them -- in a million ways -- not to bother doing. It's possible, but it's difficult. And there are no shortcuts.",

THE threat is imperial chauvinism: a seemingly unshakeable allegiance to a globe-spanning imperialist system that imbues the settler working class with an instinctive material interest in preserving that order. https://t.co/AMCuMZEVkX This is the core contradiction that must be resolved if we want to drive out all the other movement-abjuring tendencies, such as opportunism and reformism. The tension between working class liberation and the abolition of a global system that funnels resources toward the core. It's not a particularly difficult contradiction to resolve, in terms of pure theory. Even setting aside questions of \"morality,\" and \"justice,\" we all instinctively grasp that the entire working class is oppressed under capitalism, and that some are oppressed more heavily. But bridging the conceptual gap between \"working class liberation\" and \"complete liquidation of the US empire\" is tough. Getting people to understand that the fundamental nature of revolution means the eradication of the US in its entirety is the largest hurdle we face. Even those who earnestly believe that they are striving for the latter often fail to truly internalize what that means. Most \"western Marxists\" still have their thoughts suffused with an intractable liberalism, stemming from that empire-fed material instinct. This isn't a denunciation of those who still have some liberalism to shed -- although it IS a denunciation of those who propagate a vision of \"liberation\" that leaves imperial and colonial systems largely intact. Some know exactly what they're doing, and they do it deliberately. This includes, to varying degrees, every major \"socialist\" or \"communist\" organization in North America. Which is exactly why they continue to be legally permitted by the very states they *should* be striving to eradicate. No state tolerates the engine of its own destruction. As long as \"Don't get the feds angry with us\" is the guiding principle of your organization, it is necessarily not a revolutionary organization.\n\nYou should avoid getting shut down *tactically*, not *ideologically*. You are not here to change the system; you are here to break it.",

        "smushed_text": "Let's have a little talk about the median and how to lie with statistics!\n\nMedian is commonly cited as a useful measure of general economic prosperity, because it is very simple: the figure smack in the middle of the list, unlike the mean, which averages everything together. https://t.co/UaRST6IAI2 For example, if you have an economy where the top 10% are ASTONISHINGLY wealthy compared to everyone else, their presence skews the mean:\n\n10\n12\n13\n14\n16\n17\n84\n\nThe mean in this example would be 24, which is way higher than everyone *except* the outlier. Not helpful. Looking at the median gives us a much better approximation of where *most* people are. In the above example, the median is 14, which is in the middle of where the majority of the samples are. More helpful.\n\n(In this case, it's actually the mean of the first six figures.) Let's look at a different example:\n\n7\n9\n10\n15\n18\n20\n96\n\nHey, look at that! The median went up from 14 to 15! So did the mean, which went from 24 to 25. The economy is growing by every metric!\n\nOh wait.\n\nTake a closer look at those first three numbers. They all went down. In fact, if we take away that huge outlier, the mean of the \"normal people\" actually went *down*, to about 13.\n\nThis is the problem with using median as a measure of a dynamic system, especially one with a high degree of internal variation and no exclusion of outliers. In fact, those numbers *above* the median could skyrocket to mind-boggling heights, and the bottom percentiles could plummet to 0, and that movement would do *nothing* to affect the median:\n\n0\n0\n0\n15\n18\n20\n151\n\nMedian: 15\nMean: 51\nPeople with absolutely nothing: 43% In the same report cited by OP, we see a revealing table (Table B.1). They tease apart a little bit from these aggregate figures, and show that, at the 25th percentile, net worth was 27,100 in 2022. The median net worth was over SEVEN TIMES that.\n\nThe mean? OVER A MILLION DOLLARS The report keeps citing \"some increases in inequality,\" which is both putting it mildly (growth was 3x higher in the top 20% than in the bottom 20%) and ignores the sheer scale of the *existing* inequality.\n\nYear after year, already-high inequality ticks higher and higher. The economic benchmark that matters to people in the lower 40% -- below the median, but still a HUGE chunk of the population -- is not the growth of the median, the mean, or even their own \"growth,\" relative to abstract figures. It's the steady *bleed* of their economic position. It cannot be captured in snapshots of static figures, but must be tracked dynamically, with the full context of both time and the broader economy: \"how the other half lives.\"\n\nYou will often see figures showing growth across all percentiles, adjusted for inflation... ... but the metrics used to \"adjust for inflation\" AGAIN heavily weight the consumption habits of those higher percentiles.\n\nWe can illustrate this with another simplified example, comparing expenses and income: Expenses                    Income\n10 -&gt; 14                       11 -&gt; 13\n15 -&gt; 17                        16 -&gt; 19\n20 -&gt; 23                      24 -&gt; 31\n\nWe can clearly see that the bottom third in this example went from a slight surplus to a net deficit. Meanwhile, the *median* expenses rose 13%, while the median income rose 18.8%.\n\nThe mean expenses went up 20%, while mean income went up 23.5%\n\nWhen looking at both median and mean, income rose faster than inflation.\n\nBut for a full THIRD of the population, the opposite is true. This is an exaggerated, oversimplified example to help illustrate the way statistical measures don't grasp the full picture.\n\nIn real life, a third of the population hasn't suddenly gone from being able to save a little each month to not being able to pay their bills at all. But many HAVE gone from having a moderate surplus to very little, or none, or even started going into deficit. Sometimes temporarily, sometimes long-term. Even grouping into quintiles washes out the granularity within that bottom 20 or 40%. There's constant movement up and down. There is no existing mainstream economic measure of these dynamics, or the way in which individuals or entire cohorts can see some movement upward without that change compensating for longstanding downward trajectories. Relative to inflation, many are doing better. For some, that increase in prospects has even begun to overcome past downward mobility.\n\nAnd yet, for a solid chunk of the population, prospects have either not improved enough to dig them out of the hole, or have gotten even worse. If the top third is prosperous, the middle third is starting to stabilize, and the bottom third is in freefall, the economy is not \"improving.\"\n\nEven an economic system predicated on pushing an entire segment into abject poverty cannot sustain that segment being 30-40%. This is especially true when that system is built on the back of imperial extraction, where the vast majority of the exploitation is outsourced. The entire project relies on keeping the consequences of the inherent contradictions of capitalism as far from the center as possible. And yet they are failing at that. The economic sanctity of the core is crumbling, even as the periphery works to liberate itself. Attempts to compensate by ramping up oppression -- both through military and economic means -- only accelerate the organization of resistance. Protect the median all you want: the bottom grows more desperate, more hungry, and more organized all the same.",

Nevertheless, viral infections may play a role in \"confusing\" the immune system, categorizing safe compounds as toxins. @Rocko64_ The hypothesis is essentially that, *while* your body is already actively mounting an immune response to an infection it may be primed it to be on high alert for foreign compounds, and exposure to specific substances leads to generating antibodies to target them. @Rocko64_ Now that your immune system \"knows\" what threat to look out for, it will continuously restart that immune response every time it encounters it again.\n\nThis sounds strictly harmful, but it can lend insight to a powerful evolutionary tool for dealing with a variety of pathogens. @Rocko64_ This mechanism would essentially allow your body to have just one pathway dedicated to adapting to ANYTHING that could cause you harm, rather than requiring a comprehensive library of \"canonical\" pathogens. @Rocko64_ The simplified pathway would be:\n\nIs there something going wrong? \u27a1\ufe0fYes\u27a1\ufe0f Is there a foreign toxin? \u27a1\ufe0fYes\u27a1\ufe0f Find it \u27a1\ufe0f Trigger immune response \u27a1\ufe0f Keep a record of that toxin for future rapid response. @Rocko64_ In that context, it actually makes more sense that IgE is exclusively a mammalian thing, evolving during our history of rapidly generalizing to a variety of environments.

There's a deeply counterproductive impulse among \"Orthodox Marxists\" to pare class down to a simple proletariat-vs-bourgeoisie dialectic, and subordinate other social relations to the realm of not-quite-class. https://t.co/kj3Micrmq6 The reason Marxists have historically defined class based on access to the means of production is because that production is what shapes the entire economy, and through that, the whole of society. But it doesn't just end at \"do you or do you not own the MoP.\" For example, one major factor dominating the mode of production is the acquisition of raw materials, the need for which necessitates regimenting access to land. This dynamic drives the settler-indigenous relation, which is just as much a class relation as proletariat-bourgeois. Another factor that modulates Prole v. Booj is the determination of what kind of labor any given subpopulation is even *allowed* to perform. The concept of a precariat as a distinct entity from the classical proletariat is the ability to access wage labor in the first place. The oppressed social classes comrade Persephone was referring to are cohorts that are, for various reasons, disproportionately barred from the \"legitimate economy,\" and relegated to scraping together the means of survival at a higher rate than the dominant cohort. There are too many subtle and overt mechanisms enforcing this ostracism to examine here, but suffice to say, they comprise just as powerful a set of social and economic forces as those regimenting ownership over the means of production. The reason it's important to identify these cohorts as *classes* specifically is because these relations drive revolutionary movement, due to their barring access to the means of survival.

There is absolutely no evidence to support an accidental lab leak. Practically the only way this could have come from a lab would be if multiple circumstances (not just the RBD, but the entire apparent genomic history, the early transmission patterns, etc.) were deliberately engineered to make it LOOK zoonotic in origin.

Before we had proof of germ theory, that didn't prove miasma theory correct.\n\nAnd obviously, the rapid development of a vaccine doesn't even come close to saying anything about viral origins. As far as the labs themselves studying coronaviruses (specifically to avoid a repeat of SARS), that's a common and noble scientific pursuit. We need to understand pandemic-potential diseases and how they work in order to head them off. Labs, including at WIV, often gather field samples to detect already-circulating diseases. They also very commonly modify those samples to try to create more pathogenic strains, since in the wild, those diseases are evolving constantly, and we need to be *ahead* of evolution. It does look like a lab at WIV was studying a sample of the naturally-occurring RaTG13. SARS-CoV-2 has about 96% sequence similarity to RaTG13, much closer than its ~80% similarity to typical SARS. RaTG13 was discovered in 2013, after 3 miners died of a mysterious pneumonia. Those same samples from the miners, by the way, have later tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Several more bat coronaviruses with even *higher* similarity to SARS-CoV-2 have since been discovered.\n\nSo no WIV wasn't even specifically studying any samples that could cause COVID. I'm not saying there's no way SARS-CoV-2 came from a lab. Just like no one should be saying there's no way it came from zoonotic exposure. I'm saying that, as someone familiar with BSL protocols, the lab leak hypothesis was already very unlikely, so it needs REAL evidence.

        "smushed_text": "In 1930, fed up with the outwardly \"peaceful\" rhetoric of the existing Zionist movement, and demanding a more explicitly ethnonationalist line, a small group began work toward the formation of a fascist sect. By October 1931, they had formally organized as Brit HaBirionim. Brit HaBirionim drew as its inspiration the Fascist Party of Italy. They upheld the ideology of Revisionist Maximalism, which aimed to create a synthesis of Jewish religious law and secular statehood, with complete dominion over the entire territorial extent of Biblical Israel. They opposed communism, social democracy, liberalism, humanism, pluralism, pan-Arabism, and any other challenge to their theocratic, fascist vision for Mandatory Palestine. They employed political violence against the British, other Jewish factions, and especially Arabs. They wanted to \"extract Revisionism [the broader anti-Labor strain of Zionism] from its liberal entrapment,\" and sought to install Ze'ev Jabotinsky, founder of Revisionism as \"Duce\" of a fascist dictatorship. For the short period they operated in, they quickly gathered support. Eventually, the mounting violence wrought by Brit HaBirionim was cracked down on by the British. Support among the Jewish populace started to wane, and by 1934, the group had formally dissolved. However, its member continued their mobilization efforts. Many alumni of Brit HaBirionim brought their fascist ideology with them as they flooded Irgun, a far-right paramilitary that carried out numerous anti-Arab pogroms throughout the 30s and 40s. Later, they would help form Lehi, an even more hardline fascist paramilitary. Although Irgun and Lehi engaged in some minor skirmishes with the British and Haganah, their primary targets were Palestinian political leaders, militias, and civilians. Together, they engaged in a brutal terrorist campaign, including the infamous Deir Yassin massacre. As late as December 1940, Lehi maintained contact with the Nazis, promising help in the conquest of the middle east, in exchange for the creation of a Jewish state that would accept all Jewish refugees. 6 months later, the Nazis' systematic extermination of Jews began in earnest. In 1948, Irgun and Lehi were formally disbanded, with their members absorbed into the newly unified Israeli Defense Forces. Together with former members of Haganah, they perpetrated the Nakba, slaughtering and forcibly dispossessing over 700,000 Palestinians. The fascist roots of the Israeli occupation run deep: deeper even than Brit HaBirionim. From the very foundation of Zionist political thought, up until today, ethnonationalism has been the raison d'etre of the Zionist project.",

It meshes pretty seamlessly with a theoretical model of fascism I've been mulling over, about the two competing strains of fascism. @mo_journeys I'll have to write up a full treatise on this at some point, but the basic thesis is that Republicans are part of the Revanchist strain, while Democrats are part of the Supranational strain. Where these strains come down on various issues is determined by their orientation. @mo_journeys Israel is a unique case study in where these interests can diverge. On one hand, it has been oriented as a shining example of revanchist, ethnonationalist hegemony. On the other, it is propped up as a bulwark of the US-EU supranational order that revanchists seek to crack. @mo_journeys And what we're seeing now is discord being sown within the ranks of the revanchists over whether to split with Israel, or whether it is still useful to them. We'll have to see whether these \"opportunists\" win the day.",

        "smushed_text": "There is a persistent and troubling tendency among the broad and vaguely-defined \"left,\" that decries education and intellectualism as \"bourgeois\" and \"elitist.\"\n\nAt its core, this error stems from a valid critique of the role of education as a tool of hegemony. (1/18) The conflation of bourgeois intellectualism -- which serves to reify the hegemonic social order -- with the act of study *itself* is, paradoxically, a consequence of insufficient study. In fact, revolutionary study is the ONLY way to break the hold of bourgeois hegemony. (2/18) There is a qualitative difference between the intelligentsia of the bourgeoisie and that of the proletariat. This difference is as profound as the one between the intelligentsia of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie when the latter was coalescing into a political class. (3/18) Every class builds its particular self-education framework and the features of its ideology in the context of political economy. The education is both cause and effect, the product of rising consciousness and its motive force. (4/18) The class character of an emergent school of thought is rooted in material relations -- which drive the political priorities of that field of study-- and in its practical application in class society; the political organizing that it builds and the accompanying reaction. (5/18) The most salient feature of education is that, like all aspects of social life, the *dominant* form of education is always established as a tool of hegemony, and carries the character of the ruling class. In feudal societies, the dominant education serves the aristocracy. (6/18) \"Proper\" schools in feudal Europe were not open to the public, and attendance was a matter of aristocratic privilege. Basic education for the lower classes was sporadic, and was a function of the church, serving to further reproduce aristocratic norms. (7/18) But it was in these schools that a nascent bourgeois intelligentsia emerged. Their acculturation in aristocratic pedagogy gave them the tools to directly combat both feudal economy and aristocratic philosophy as they constructed their own schools. (8/18) The \u201cuniversal rights\u201d and \u201cself-evident truths\u201d of liberal philosophy \u2013 and the ideological movements of which they were a foundational part \u2013 were not formulated from thin air. They were developed over centuries of study, emerging as critique of the dominant ideology. (9/18) As bourgeois dominance came to be cemented, the ideology they had developed was transmitted down the generations through bourgeois schools \u2013 same as the aristocratic schools had done, centuries earlier. (10/18) It is in this context that the proletarian ideology began to take shape. In many cases, it was driven by those at the nebulous class boundary \u2013 the lawyers, bureaucrats, small bourgeois, etc., who were acculturated in bourgeois thought and best positioned to expose it. (11/18) Since its quasi-proletarian beginnings, proletarian ideology and the educational mode that synthesizes it have come to be deeply characterized by the classes that uphold and advance it: the oppressed peoples of the world. (12/18) In every social context, the local conditions dictate the particular form of the emergent and evolving proletarian study; education is, as mentioned, a dialectic between theory and its practice, each feeding the other. (13/18) But despite the different iterations, adapted to disparate iterations of political economy, the overall content and form of proletarian education remains incontrovertible: it is the theory of liberation of the oppressed classes. (14/18) To assert that we cannot have an expectation of education \u2013 that it is secondary to the purity of action and the epistemology of merely *existing* under oppression \u2013 is to fall prey to the explicit aim of the bourgeois educational framework. (15/18) The single greatest feat of all aspects of hegemony is the naturalization of the dominant regime. In the field of education, this is accomplished by smothering all countervailing tendencies, and subsuming them into passivity and impotence. (16/18) Revolutionary pedagogy reclaims education from the ruling class. It tears down the ideological fences that enclose the fields of science, history, literacy, economy, and so on, keeping the masses from using that space to cultivate our movement. (17/18) Education is the glue that binds past to present movements, the microscope that magnifies the contradictions, the scalpel that excises regressive tendencies, the piston that turns the wheel of revolution. It is utterly indispensable. (18/18) [This thread is an adapted excerpt from a book-length theoretical treatise/practical guide I am writing, tentatively named Pedagogy of the Liberated.]",

They see the seizure of land as a historical event and genocide as a cost of concentrating production into one place for proletarian seizure. They are willfully ignorant of the dialectic between land and capital, the latter's need to constantly cut into the former and keep the blood flowing freely, using that blood to grow its teeth and sink them deeper. They see the movement to end this bloodletting as \"moralizing.\" This isn't just a question of justice, of one genetic lineage having a moral entitlement over another. It's about undermining the very foundation of the capitalist project. Decolonization isn't just about liberating the *people*, it's about liberating the *land*. The same is true for every liberation movement of every oppressed population. The oppression isn't just \"capital being mean.\" The cruelty is NOT the point. Each particular form of oppression serves a material function for the regime -- and is a key vulnerability. Relegating particularized oppression to the realm of \"We'll deal with it by getting rid of capitalism\" is like dismissing each battlefield by saying \"We'll just win the war, then the battlefields will disappear.\"\n\nYou win the war by fighting on its many battlefields. When you see many different militias springing up to fight in isolated battles against the same enemy, you don't tell them \"Why are you so obsessed with defending your own village? Don't you see that it'll all be taken care of once the war ends?\" You JOIN those battles. You include those fighters in a growing logistical network. You bring them weapons and food. You send them reinforcements and tactical briefings. You bring their generals on board to central command. You make their needs and resources the needs and resources of the collective. This \"analogy\" is not some idle illustrative exercise: it's the exact progression of every successful revolution in history. It's how the Red Army was built. It's what's happening in Palestine as we speak. And it's what has to happen here as well.",

The persistence of this myth -- especially among clinicians who haven't kept up with the science -- has been incredibly harmful for people with CFS. @pigeon_pretty \"CFS\" is a broad term that refers to a specific category of disease *presentation*, but with a wide variety of known and unknown etiologies. Its emergence following viral (more so than bacterial) infection is so common that it is designated its own subcategory. @pigeon_pretty Among the ways we know it is not psychosomatic comes in the form of an astonishing array of biochemical studies that have investigated metabolic, immunologic, neurologic, and other physiological pathways, finding significant divergences from the healthy population. @pigeon_pretty Stress does not cause a concomitant rise in pro-inflammatory markers and sharp decline in levels of hypoxanthine, or heightened excretion of methylhistidine, mannitol, and acetate. These are metabolic factors: an inability to extract energy from glucose and breaking down muscles. @pigeon_pretty I could go into endless detail on this, but the executive summary is this: it is absolutely not helpful to psychologize a biochemical condition.

Liberation of the colonial base of modern imperialism cuts off the flow of material resources needed to buy compliance. The U.S. is already doing a terrible job of distributing the spoils. https://t.co/d19HYniqB5 As the targets of imperialism shake off the chains of colonial rule, the plenitude of cheap consumer goods in the core declines. The falling rate of profit spirals even faster, and exploitation of workers here accelerates, exposing the inherent contradictions of the system. By the same token, the success of revolution in the periphery relies on internal pressure placed on the empire at home (and of course, direct material support). We're all part of the same feedback loop. Internationalism is not just moral, but *inseparable* from revolution. The mass of people who cannot afford basic necessities will skyrocket. If communists have already been doing the work of building organizational infrastructure to fold in an expanding base of desperate workers, revolution becomes inevitable. If not... fascism. The question of \"revolutionary potential\" itself fails to see the world in motion. Revolution is a positive feedback loop, where potential is *built* through the process of doing revolutionary organizing. That organizing needs to keep pace with the decline in material conditions. This requires us to conceptualize each necessary step of the decline of empire, use what we already have to meet the moment, and expand our organizational capacity.

The ideology of the US settler colonial empire was copy-pasted and applied directly to the occupation of Palestine, which is propped up as its outpost. Hinkle attempts to invert this relationship and present Zionism as... https://t.co/VSFjAKB8fV ... a conspiracy, puppeteering an otherwise beneficent United States. This is a fascist schema, pointing to the most unavoidable contradictions and collapsing them into a single, readily-propagated \"subversion\" that can be extracted without challenging the extant hierarchy. The central project of \"patsocs\" is to retain colonial relations and bourgeois hegemony, while isolating all oppressed groups whose liberation necessitates the destruction of that hegemony. They do so while adopting a vaguely communist patina to foster aesthetics over revolution. To answer the question of \"Who are you??\" I'm an actual Marxist. I also happen to be a member of several of the groups Hinkle and his fascist ilk would see destroyed. The real liberation movement recognizes the material interaction of all these forces and seeks to eliminate them.",

This is such a crucial error among western Marxists: so much hinges on recognizing and understanding the enemy.\n\nBut I can't just toss out quick replies, because the subject can't be condensed. I'm in the process of writing a book on the intersecting dynamics of fascism, liberalism, and capitalism. They can't be conflated, nor can they be disentangled. Politics, economy, and philosophy must be understood dialectically if we are to stand a chance of coherent struggle. At some point, I'll try to post a suitable summary of the main theses I'm working on. In the meantime, I highly recommend George Jackson's Blood in My Eye to begin understanding just how pertinent a holistic analysis of fascism in the US empire is to our movement.",

We are watching in real time as one strain is overtaking the one that became hegemonic following WWII. As conditions change, the definition of \"correct\" does too. Biological evolution works this way as well. \"Fitness\" is a dialectical phenomenon. As species evolve to fit their environments, their environments change -- both due to geological shifts and more crucially, due to the activities of the organisms as *they* change. Getting bigger, stronger, faster, etc. is not necessarily \"getting fitter.\" The \"correct\" evolutionary strategy is whatever works best for the environment you're in and what you have to work with. And that will change. Unlike with biological evolution though, we are able to rigorously study our environment, our history, and our options, then *plan* our strategy. We aren't tossed around by the whims of inscrutable forces and passive evolution. But we're still restricted by what is possible. Success means analyzing what's possible and then actually doing it.

It rests on a facile conception of \u201cwhat is,\u201d that philosophically positions even the most fundamental building blocks of reality as having immutable \u201cessences.\u201d (1/25) The atom, it is claimed, is composed of tiny nuclei, made of protons and neutrons, and collections of even tinier electrons moving around them at distances so vast in comparison to the size of the subatomic particles as to make the atom itself largely the nothingness (2/25) where none of those particles happen to be. The picture painted is of an atomic snapshot, with the infinitesimal electrons frozen, as if they are planets orbiting a star, millions of miles away, with nothing in between them. (3/25) But this picture is so flawed as to be completely useless for demonstrating the properties and interactions of atoms. Electrons cannot be thought of as static objects, occupying first one point, then another, then another. (4/25) The space within an atom where an electron happens to not be currently \u201coccupying\u201d with the simple presence of its mass is nevertheless still part of that electron\u2019s \u201clocation.\u201d (5/25) A house is not \u201cmostly vacant,\u201d just because its occupants happen to not be in every inch of every room at all times. Their presence is made clear by their regular activities as they move throughout their home: the furniture they arranged, the decor they collected, (6/25) the dishes in the sink, the half-full garbage can, the light left on in the bathroom, the stray hair that drifted behind the couch. Every moment they move through the \u201cempty space\u201d of the house, they influence its character. Their heat radiates out through the walls. (7/25) Their respiration alters the house\u2019s carbon dioxide concentration. That their mass happens to stay confined to one point within the house at any given moment is not especially relevant. (8/25) The fact is that the house is occupied, and the particularities of that occupation have direct ramifications on the relationship of the house to its direct environment. It has physical impacts that extend beyond its confines, such as its energy usage, (9/25) the way its foundation distributes load into the ground beneath, the displacement of water during storms, or the diversion of natural wind patterns. It also has social impacts, which are of course dependent on the context in which that house and its occupants live. (10/25) Occupied houses can be used as leverage for the displacement of other residents, they can be focal points of community building, they can provide local capitalists with a stable supply of workers, or they can be temporary havens for those with nowhere else to sleep. (11/25) Houses can act as noble gasses \u2014 isolated atoms, drifting through space without ever forming bonds \u2014 or they can be akin to carbon atoms, linking together to form molecules of unimaginable complexity, with collective properties that form the basis of life itself. (12/25) The humble electron, then, is not merely a point mass. It can be understood only in the context of its movement, its attraction and repulsion of other particles, and its extensive influence across its entire environment. (13/25) An atom is not \u201cmostly empty\u201d; its space is completely filled up with the movement of its electrons. The electromagnetic forces they exert, the bonds they form with other atoms, the energy given and received to change states are all there. (14/25) This distinction is not simply idle pedantry. It exposes a profound conceptual gulf left behind by liberal ideology, one in which people, objects, and events are torn from their context and presented as unitary, stationary, and unchanging. (15/25) We can think of this broader misunderstanding of the dialectical relationship between objects and their context, as the \u201cpoint mass fallacy.\u201d Its manifestation in bourgeois culture is often referred to obliquely as \u201cindividualism\u201d... (16/25) ... although that doesn\u2019t do justice to the sheer depth and breadth of the ideological obfuscation involved. The conceptualization of reality itself is warped by the point mass, and leaves those educated and socialized under bourgeois hegemony adrift. (17/25) Struggling to make sense of the world around them, and struggling to organize to change it.\n\nThis theoretical malfeasance is crucial to the maintenance of liberal society, and forms the foundation of its many philosophical pillars. (18/25) It lurks within essentialism, the notion that objects are defined by \u201cessences,\u201d which imbue them with eternal, metaphysical characteristics, unbroken and distilled down to an object as it exists in isolation. (19/25) It hides itself in the \u201cnuclear family,\u201d a bourgeois construct that attempts to strip mother, father, and child of all external forces that could influence social reproduction.  (20/25) It builds its home in the consignment of history to a void of abstraction, unable to touch contemporary events.\n\nIt is perfectly situated within the fascist ethos that posits nations, genders, races, and classes as occupying \u201cnatural\u201d places within social hierarchies... (21/25) \u2026 with any attempt at movement being met with blood and bile and steel: the static point mass must be maintained if the liberal regime is to survive. (22/25) Neither physical nor social space is ever empty. It is filled with the tension of interacting forces, fully occupied by the movements of its constituent parts.(23/25) The forest is not made of isolated trees: it is soil and birds and seeds and vines and insects and mycorrhiza and climate and atmosphere and megafauna and water table and minerals clostridium and tectonic plates and nematodes and the endless flow of elements and energy. (24/25) The world is in motion. We are moved by it, and we move it. It is only by understanding the collective properties of our world -- physical and social forces alike -- that we are empowered to direct that movement toward liberation. (25/25)",

        "smushed_text": "Israel's policy of \"tactical ambiguity\" around its nuclear weapons leads me to believe that they are the most likely state on the planet to actually use them.\n\nTo be clear: Israel DOES have nuclear weapons. This is recognized as fact by Israel's allies, such as the US. Along with India and Pakistan, Israel is the only nuclear-armed nation never to sign the non-proliferation treaty. North Korea had signed on, but has since backed out.\n\nSo why is Israel alone among non-signatories in refusing to acknowledge its nuclear stockpile? The concept of mutually-assured destruction (MAD) has long governed nations' nuclear policies. Simply *having* nuclear weapons and the rockets to deliver them is a form of protection against other nuclear powers. That is why, for example, North Korea does not hide it. Every nuclear and rocket test done by North Korea is a way to reaffirm that attacking them would be disastrous. Whether or not you agree with the \"morality\" of nuclear proliferation, it still remains an irrevocable form of deterrence. But only if everyone knows you have nukes. Israel has nuclear weapons, but refuses to admit it.\n\nIn combat, it's generally proper strategy to hide your true capabilities from your enemies. Let them underestimate you, then overwhelm them with something they failed to account for. Israel understands this concept well. However, this strategy only applies when the greater tactical advantage comes from *using* the hidden capability. In certain cases, revealing your capabilities yields better results. For example, shouting \"We have you surrounded!\" rather than rushing in and creating chaos. Nuclear weapons are the ultimate \"We have you surrounded.\" The destruction they cause is so complete as to negate any other tactical advantages held by the target.\n\nActually *deploying* them is also the greatest evil one could commit in the service of war. By constructing and maintaining its nuclear arsenal without revealing it, Israel is essentially \"surrounding\" the enemy and not actually announcing their position. They are not seeking surrender.\n\nThey are primed to storm in, chaos and bloodshed be damned. I don't think they're crazy enough to actually break with the accepted norm of \"don't bathe the world in fallout.\"\n\nBut of all the nuclear powers, they are the only one that clearly prizes the tactical advantage of the fog of war over a clear warning not to mess with them.",

        "smushed_text": "After Italy, Japan, Austria, Britain, France, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, and Spain had all signed non-aggression pacts or territorial treaties with Nazi Germany, the USSR finally decided to solidify what they knew was a very temporary peace with them as well. \ud83e\uddf5 Both knew this was a transient arrangement. Both saw the other as an existential threat; the Nazis' Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan, Italy, Hungary, and Spain made it very clear that communism was their primary enemy, and nullified Weimar-era peace treaties with the USSR. The Nazis and the Soviets both perceived war with each other as inevitable in the long-run, but disastrous in the short-term. Both were in the process of industrializing as quickly as possible to prepare for this inevitability, although the USSR had much more ground to cover. The USSR knew that it had to secure itself a separate peace -- especially after the Munich Agreement demonstrated that Britain and France had no intention of denying German expansion. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed to head off the Nazis nibbling at the USSR's territory. It was only once Poland refused to join the Anti-Comintern Pact that the Nazis broke their agreement and invaded. When they did, Britain and France declared war -- and then did almost nothing. Within 15 days, Germany had rolled over most of Poland, before the Soviets mobilized. The Soviet invasion of Poland was not some cynical war of opportunistic conquest: it was a defensive maneuver. The Wehrmacht had no plans to stop at the Vistula, per the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, as we can see from Franz Halder's war journal -- and the Soviets knew that. It was only once the Red Army arrived that the German advance was halted -- much to the frustration of the German High Command. Halder called it \"a day of shame.\" Every world power at that time understood the dynamics at play: Germany was invading, the Soviets were stopping them. Ever wonder why Britain and France immediately declared war on Germany when they invaded, but were fine with the USSR \"joining in\"? It's because they knew it was not a joint operation. They were hoping fighting would break out between the two. But both were too smart for that. They both still refused to engage until they were \"ready.\" Germany's main goal remained the complete domination of the USSR to put down the revolutionary government, subjugate the \"lesser races,\" and expropriate the land. \"The Volga must be our Mississippi,\" after all. However, it was now already at war with the western powers, whom Hitler perceived to be a more immediate priority. He knew he needed the industrial core of Europe in order to mobilize a sufficient military capable of what would eventually be the largest land invasion in history. The USSR on the other hand, also still needed to industrialize further. Preemptively making war with Germany at this stage would be disastrous. They knew the western powers would be all too eager to sit out the conflict and leave Germany to invade, pillage, and occupy them. (Remember the context: Britain and France had JUST demonstrated that exact attitude toward the invasion of Poland by not launching a full counter-offensive, or even providing Poland with any significant military armament. Before that, they had helped carve up Czechoslovakia.) So Germany halted to buy time for the Big Invasion, and the USSR halted to buy time for *defending* against it.\n\nThis was not a planned, joint conquest. It was Soviets ensuring that Germany got as little of Eastern Europe as possible, to further delay the brewing storm.",

Developmentally, morphologically, and genetically, across a range of populations, it is either absent entirely or vestigial. https://t.co/nMn8JKlpNp In cadaver studies across age groups, the VNO has been found to be most likely to even be present at all in infants, and even then it is tiny. Genetic studies have found high rates of variability in genes that, in other animals, are conserved and expressed highly in the VNO. This indicates that these genes are non-functional: if they did something, they would be conserved. The same is true of the wide variability of morphology across individuals. Think of wisdom teeth -- in any given person, they can be full size, smaller, or never form at all. Of course, the main reason to not believe that humans can detect pheromones is simply that scientists have been studying it for a long time, and have never been able to conclusively demonstrate pheromone sensitivity at all. None of this necessarily indicates that it's *impossible* for *some* humans to have *some* pheromone sensitivity. But if they do, it would be the ones who: 1) actually have a VNO, 2) actually express functional receptor genes, and 3) the effect would be miniscule. This is the general rule when it comes to highly-studied phenomena: if we've been searching for it, and we can't find it, that means any effect it might  POSSIBLY have is non-obvious and niche.

How would such a thing even happen? Do you really think birds are out there in the wild spotting predators and going \"Oh wow, look at all those tiny birds, clustered into one large cat-like mass, somehow moving in complete unison\"? Do you think they don't know the difference between bird and non-bird? There are sympatric populations of birds that are so closely related that they could theoretically interbreed, but are able to discern infinitesimal differences to allow them to specifically choose mates from their own species. And you think they think TOES are birds???",

Apparently, Baltimore is trying to prep by modestly tweaking budgets of other departments, rather than radically shifting our budgeting priorities. The finance department asked each department to make lists of their budgetary priorities, and note the 5% lowest priority projects. This would wreak havoc on the bare-bones Rec and Parks budget, for a gain of ~$3 million, and allow BPD to remain bloated. None of it comes close to the amount we need according to the Kirwan formula. They keep saying we can't cut more (the police budget absolutely could be cut more than 5%), and we can't raise taxes, because we already have a high tax burden (unless you're a giant corporation). The solution is simple. We need to accept spending on deficit. Borrow $100 million/year while our students make their way through the school system, incentivize them staying here, then slowly phase in higher income taxes to pay off that debt. We'd have a new crop of educated, productive young people paying into the system. Crimes of desperation would fall sharply--once we stop leaving people behind--so we could further ramp down the police.",

Enjoy spending twice as long cooking and ending up with turkey jerky. Or trying to figure out a way to scrape every bit of stuffing back *out* of a giant, burning hot bird to finish cooking. Orrrrr you could just cook stuffing by itself. They sometimes call it dressing, but no one actually cares. It's bread, aromatic veggies, herbs, and spices, melded into a delicious, carby melange. Perfect side dish for all occasions. It doesn't also need to make you violently ill.",

At first, it was just a thief with a gun, mugging their victim directly. That evolved into a contract, to make the theft \"official.\" The thief got tired of holding the gun, so they hired someone else to hold it for them. The thief then wrote philosophical treatises on how elegant and natural the whole system is. Perhaps they claim the gun was given to them by some divine force. Perhaps they claim the victim willingly gave them the gun. Perhaps the gun is proof of their innate superiority. Either way, the victim obviously cannot just stop signing the contract. They cannot dictate new terms. They cannot even refuse to uphold their end of this lopsided bargain. They cannot do anything without first seizing the gun. On this, Leninists and anarchists agree. Except anarchists seem to think the victim should just throw away the gun, without first drawing up a new contract, sitting the thief down, and reclaiming what has been stolen for centuries.",

Who let you in here??\" @rednewafrikan I know that sounds uncharitable to people who are totally comfortable with their masculinity, and don't or can't use it to dominate other, including trans men (who now also have to navigate that same interrogation). But that's the best illustration I can conjure at the moment.",

Think of how English once had \u00de, but now must use the digraph \"th\" to represent that phoneme. Pronunciations change. It's silly to map a missing phoneme directly onto an existing one, simply because the letter used to represent the extant sound used to be pronounced differently. There are many ways to indicate that a missing phoneme *would* be used there -- such as the \"kh\" digraph for \u05d7 The reason people mock this particular transposition is that it feels intentional. Without the ability to pronounce the voiceless pharyngeal fricative, it would be just as easy to pronounce it with the glottal, just like English speakers do for everything past the velar fricative Pronouncing it as \"Khamas\" comes across as deliberately trying to distinguish themselves from both English and Arabic pronunciation, to play up their \"levantine credentials.\" Despite, as noted, the clear absence of the ancestral phoneme found in both Arabic AND ancient Hebrew. (It's also not really that hard to pronounce the voiceless pharyngeal fricative, especially if you can already do the uvular. Lack of effort, skill issue, etc.)",

Do these people not even stop to question why every institutional power in the west -- governments, think tanks, media outlets -- propagate the idea that Xinjiang is being genocided based off nothing, while denying the Palestinian genocide we can all watch in real time?",

It would have been weird for people to memorize the written section, and unthinkable to NOT memorize the oral one. @HellcatFellOff But of course, the oral tradition eventually was written down, because people were forgetting it lol. That became the Mishnah. Over the generations, as prominent rabbis debated endlessly over it, their discussions became codified into the behemoth text that is the Talmud. @HellcatFellOff Later, even MORE commentary was appended onto the already codified Talmud, as well as the Tanakh. These commentaries are more considered supplementary for study purposes, not really \"scriptural.\"\n\nAnd then there are Midrash and Aggadah, which are still very much oral traditions.",

        "smushed_text": "The simplest aspect of this phenomenon is simply selection bias: you're drawing on examples of giant things across a variety of eras. Throughout history, all you would need is one example of \"the biggest ape ever\" or \"the biggest bird ever,\" to point to... (1/12) https://t.co/H75T1rjcXw ... as an example of how much \"smaller\" animals are now. In fact, there are many counterexamples when you take a more holistic view: for example, the current era is undeniably The Age of Giant Mammals, compared to our size when our tiny ancestors emerged in the Mesozoic. (2/12) Before that, therapsids were pretty huge, but on the whole, modern mammals have reached comparatively staggering sizes. Following the K-Pg extinction, the enormous dinosaurs died out due to the sharp decline in food availability. Less sun-&gt; less plant growth -&gt; less energy (3/12) Adaptive radiation of those tiny, burrowing early mammals took off, since they needed much less energy. Many later adapted to fill empty niches, including the various \"Biggest Thing Around\" niches. More plants meant giant herbivores, and therefore giant carnivores. (4/12) Over the course of tens of millions of years, huge species emerged, but then disappeared. The biggest organisms are also the most vulnerable to environmental changes, because slight perturbations can't be adapted to as easily. (5/12) Large organisms need long reproductive cycles to gather the resources necessary to reproduce, which means slower evolution.\n\nSo the best explanation of why there are relatively few giant animals right now is that there are ALWAYS relatively few giant animals... (6/12) ... due to ecological constraints. And the ones that exist are the quickest to disappear when environmental conditions change.\n\nThe final note I'll make is that a lot of megafauna died out shortly after the appearance of humans in their ecosystems. (7/12) This is mainly due to us competing for the same resources that they did. Hunting is also partially to blame, but for most extinct megafauna species, the main threat was just humans being much more efficient at gathering limited resources. (8/12) We also deliberately pushed away those species that competed with us. The human evolutionary strategy kinda subverts that pattern of larger species having less capacity to adapt to changes in environments: we are the supreme generalists. (9/12) Humans use sociality and tools to adapt to almost every ecosystem we have ever encountered. But we're certainly not immune to that fundamental geophysical constraint. We can't get energy from nowhere, and we can't photosynthesize. (10/12) That's the problem with climate change: environmental conditions are changing so rapidly that organisms throughout the food web of ALL ecosystems are dying out, and the energy flow falls apart. The current era is not currently characterized by unusually tiny animals. (11/12)",

A stick is just a thin piece of wood, typically understood as being fallen or harvested from a tree.\n\n\"Tree\" is surprisingly difficult to rigorously define, but generally we think of a tall, perennial, woody plant. https://t.co/WquHtQR2gD Tall? Bamboo clears that easily.\n\nPerennial? Yup, bamboo persists through the seasons.\n\nWoody? Here it's more open to interpretation. Bamboo is made of cellulose and lignin -- the composition of wood. Most bamboo are specifically \"woody,\" as opposed to the herbaceous species. Bamboo is certainly more woody than other things we commonly call trees: banana trees, papaya trees, Joshua trees, etc. All of these are distinctly herbaceous -- their growth is supported by thick, non-ligneous fibers. In terms of chemistry, a piece of bamboo is just as much of a stick as a branch with its bark stripped off. In terms of biology, there is no universal definition that excludes bamboo. In terms of application, you can use a piece of bamboo exactly how you would a stick. In fact, a stalk of developed, woody bamboo easily surpasses the vast majority of sticks in usefulness. It's straight, thick, strong, durable, and versatile, in ways some random twig you found on the ground is unlikely to measure up to.\n\nHappy sticking everyone!",

The most common producers are plants. https://t.co/DP3sMh4Nhe The things that eat producers are called Primary Consumers. These organisms get all of their energy from those same food molecules made by producers.\n\nSecondary Consumers get energy by eating primary consumers (and possibly also producers), and so on. Over the course of an animal's life, it has to eat WAY more biomass from the trophic levels below than the amount of biomass it creates for itself. How many pounds of food do you imagine you've eaten in your life? Probably around 10 times your weight every year alone. This means that any contaminants that stick around in the body tend to *accumulate* as you go up the trophic layers. If plants suck up 1 unit per pound of a contaminant in the water, the primary consumers will have 10 units per pound, secondary consumers will have 100/pound, etc. That's why seafood at the top of the food chain (like swordfish) presents a high risk of mercury poisoning, while salmon is fine. The krill that salmon eat have infinitesimal amounts of mercury in them, while the things that eat the things that eat salmon have &gt;1,000x as much. So even \"low\" amounts of contamination in the base of an ecosystem, such as in the water, can be critically toxic by the time humans eat the things that eat the things that eat the things that eat contaminated plants, as long as those contaminants stick around in those organisms. Normally, these ecosystems are full of organisms that have evolved to deal with whatever chemicals there are in the environment. They metabolize, sequester, excrete, and otherwise eliminate unnecessary molecules before they can reach dangerous concentrations. But when humans introduce a foreign substance through pollution, the organisms might not have evolved any biological methods for getting it *out* of the food chain. That's how we end up with fish that are \"equivalent to a month of contaminated water.\"",

Waiting a day or longer is only done in extraordinary circumstances\n-Sh'mira: Someone should be designated to watch over the body until burial\n- Tahara: ritual cleansing of the body https://t.co/bkpelfGZvd - Tachrichim: 100% linen shrouds in which the deceased is wrapped.\n- Talit: if one was worn during life, the deceased should be covered in a prayer shroud with one of the fringes removed to signify it is no longer to be used.\n- Aron: if a casket is used, it must be unadorned wood It is *preferable* for the body to be intact, but this is not even close to being a requirement. Organ donation is not only permitted, but encouraged. In the case of death resulting from dismemberment, *any* retrievable body part may be used for the burial. Burying these vehicles because \"the bodies are trapped inside, and need to be whole\" is an utter falsehood. Burying an intact body is so far down the list of importance in a Jewish burial, especially in the case of violent death. Far more important are speed and ritual cleansing.",
