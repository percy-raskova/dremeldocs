# the occupation

Actually, if you don't want to enlist, you can just... leave the occupation. Stop living in a military garrison if you don't like being forced to serve the military. https://t.co/DGXfcp9dD4 Yes, I know it's not that simple to pick up your whole life and move to another country, especially when you're 18. Sorry to all the 18-year-olds put in that terrible situation by their parents.

But tough shit. Leave or you are culpable. If I was raised in a home that kept a bunch of victims chained up in the basement, and was told since birth that, as a privilege of getting to live in the house, I would eventually have to help torture them, my utmost priority would be moving out of the house before then.
