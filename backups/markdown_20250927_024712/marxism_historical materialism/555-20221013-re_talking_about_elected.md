# re talking about elected 

@JordanLovesMarx I know you clarified that you're talking about elected "leftists" (i.e. social democrats), but honestly, even if we're talking about actual communist orgs, it's still a valid critique. There is a genuine lack of internationalism in most left circles here. @JordanLovesMarx Which is insanity, because unequal exchange is the primary contradiction of modern capitalism. I get it when it comes from social democrats, who KNOW they can't do what they want to help the US working class without modern colonial extraction. But I expect more from "Marxists."
