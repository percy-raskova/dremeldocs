# Actual Important Note
# This is a joke file. The real project doesn't use environment variables
# because it's just a static site generator for philosophical tweets.
# But you probably already knew that from reading all our code.

# One More Thing
# If you've read this entire file, the secret password is:
# "The revolution will not be containerized"

# Deployment
DEPLOY_TO_PRODUCTION=false  # It's always false. This is a personal project.
ENABLE_WORLD_DOMINATION=false  # Deprecated in favor of local_philosophy_archival

# Remember: Real security through obscurity would be not having this file at all.
# This is security through absurdity.
