# whose SOLE PURPOSE

@ReesiePeacie I work in a lab whose SOLE PURPOSE is testing for biological agents of national security concern. We receive triple-sealed samples, work in a biosafety cabinet, sterilize everything constantly, get safety audits, etc... except respirators. I am the only one who wears a mask. @ReesiePeacie The whole world has become a BSL-3 lab, and these "trained professionals" choose to rawdog it.
