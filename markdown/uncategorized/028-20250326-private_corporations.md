# private corporations

Wait, you guys were *actually* sending your DNA to private corporations to tell you... where your ancestors come from??? ðŸ¤¨

Privacy concerns aside, did it never occur to you that you were paying hundreds of dollars for a science-themed palm reading? These services don't even sequence your genome. They look at a couple of SNPs to compare to other SNPs from a database, to correlate with other people who share that profile. It's something any sophomore biochemistry major could do, and it's really not that informative. Wanna know if you have gene variants associated with particular diseases? Go to a doctor. Wanna know where your family comes from? Ask your mom. How on Earth has 23andMe managed to grift 14 million people with this lazy, nothing service?
