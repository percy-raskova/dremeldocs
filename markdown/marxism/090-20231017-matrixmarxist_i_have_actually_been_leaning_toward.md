# @matrixmarxist I have actually been leaning toward this as...

@matrixmarxist I have actually been leaning toward this as a solution. The problem is still actually sitting down to actively *write*, where the activation energy is simply too high. But I find it pretty easy to ramble verbally, and I plan to try recording that for later transcription/curation. @matrixmarxist Obviously the transcribing and curating and refining and editing is also a huge mentally taxing task. But I have some excellent comrades who have expressed interest in helping with that ðŸ˜Š
