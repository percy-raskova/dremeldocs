# t met as an attack on you personally: after years of living...

@yaneerbaryam This wasn't met as an attack on you personally: after years of living through the western "let it rip" philosophy, I've become sensitized to "no lockdowns," which is often meant to include no mask mandates, no quarantines, no site-specific closures, no virtual school, etc. @yaneerbaryam I guess the key distinction here is what you *do* with those mass tests. It's not enough to just test everyone: there have to be very specific metrics for how worksites, schools, and governments respond to outbreaks. Especially since people can't be expected to "just stay home."
