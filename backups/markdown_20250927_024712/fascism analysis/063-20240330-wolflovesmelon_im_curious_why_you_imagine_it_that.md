# @wolflovesmelon I'm curious *why* you imagine it that way

@wolflovesmelon I'm curious *why* you imagine it that way.

That's kind of the main point of this poll in the first place: to highlight just how deeply we've been instilled with perceptions based solely on vibes, without actually knowing anything. Mythologized impressions become "common sense." @wolflovesmelon China is authoritarian and represses freedom because... well, it's China! Everyone knows that! You can tell based on those things you always hear about it. And I believe those things, because it makes sense -- since China is authoritarian! @wolflovesmelon Athens! The birthplace of democracy! They may not have gotten it perfect, but they were trying. And I can tell they were trying, because... well, it's Athens! I mean sure, they somehow didn't consider that the other 90% of the population should have rights, but nobody's perfect!
