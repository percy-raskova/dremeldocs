# s tempting to denigrate people for whom THIS was what woke...

It's tempting to denigrate people for whom THIS was what woke them up to just how dumb this dog-and-pony "democracy" is.

But I get it. You've been lied to since birth about the high-minded ideals of liberalism. It can take a couple good slaps in the face to shake it off. I think the key to political development is learning to generalize. Taking all these individual instances of a "failing system," putting them together in context, and realizing that it's not a failure after all: the system is just not at all what you were told it was. I hope that seeing such stark examples before your very eyes -- unending support for genocide, empty lip service, steadily declining conditions no matter who's in charge, actively decomposing president, etc. -- would help you start asking "What else have I been lied to about?" You've been lied to about basically everything, from specific details to broad narratives, all the way down to "fundamental values" you didn't even realize were part of that same system of holistic deception. It's hard to even list out the lies without sounding like a crank. Obviously a twitter thread is not the best place to start airing out the specifics.

But I hope everyone looking on in horror at just how far the US has "fallen" can pull themselves together long enough to realize... it hasn't fallen. What you're starting to see was always there.
