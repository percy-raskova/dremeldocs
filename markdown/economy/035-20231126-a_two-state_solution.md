# a two-state solution

Since the founding of "Israel," but especially since 67, Zionists have worked tirelessly to preclude a two-state solution. Every step of the way, they've been told "Ok, stop expanding the settlements," and "Israel" has said "Yup. Sure. I hear you. üëç" and plowed ahead regardless. https://t.co/5va2boQBmt They have made it absolutely clear with every new constitution, law, resolution, investment, propaganda message, and action, that their one and only goal is the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians through dispossession of land, demographic displacement, and economic embargo. Every scholar, institution, resistance group, and person with a working brain has said it for decades: the settlements are a deliberate effort to alter the demographic make-up of the region, and then wail about the "human rights" of the settlers to prevent rectification. "Israel" has never been restricted in its ambitions on this front, nor have they ever hidden those ambitions. The settler colony has never been legitimate in the first place, but it has also never respected the facile "international law" that has pretended to keep it in check. It has abided by no laws, no treaties, no toothless words of admonition from its imperial benefactor, and certainly no sense of decency. They do not want a two-state solution -- despite that ALREADY being a grotesque seizure of land. All they want is elimination of Palestinians.
