# we, us, our

A crucial habit for Marxists to get into is to stop referring to the US as "we, us, our," etc. The empire is not something to identify with as an inextricable part of your identity. It's something to be overcome, materially and ideologically. You can feel guilt over the ways the empire materially benefits you, but guilt doesn't end empires. Action does. Take that guilt, render it to rage, set that rage aflame, and burn down your enemy.

Any less, and you will find yourself fighting to defend your "us" from the flames.
