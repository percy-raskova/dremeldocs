# @RossCol89474735 Capitalists

@RossCol89474735 Capitalists are obsessed with monoculture. If you only plant one type of crop in an area, fruit trees have a lower calorie-per-acre yield than grains and pulses.

If you intersperse different plants, you can pack way more food into a space and with much more sustainable soil. @RossCol89474735 The reason they focus on monoculture crops like corn is because it's more profitable if you don't have to hire as many workers, and can just process everything with one series of semi-automated tools. But this requires *more* capital investment to compensate for land degradation.
