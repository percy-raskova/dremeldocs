# full-on panic attacks

Liberal friends and family having full-on panic attacks are asking *me* if I'm ok.

I'm not the one who has tied their emotional well-being into the smooth functioning of a rapidly disintegrating imperial apparatus.

I've got dialectical materialism. I've got plans. I'm peachy. I think they parse me as "political ' in their vague, vibes-based liberal conception, and therefore assume I'd be the *most* invested in the outcome of a fascist-on-fascist arms race.
