# Just a bunch of nerds spending all their time reading...

@BlackRedGuard1 This realization was why I got exhausted with the book club culture of the DSA about two months into joining them back when I was a baby leftist.

Just a bunch of nerds spending all their time reading people telling them that spending all your time reading is pointless ðŸ™„ @BlackRedGuard1 Early on, I presented a proposal that we should allocate funds for training and equipping members as security and got laughed off. That was back when I thought we'd be doing literally *anything* that would necessitate security.
