# sticky secretions

There's a species of plant that oozes sticky secretions to trap tiny bugs. But it can't digest them. Instead, the stuck bugs act as bait, attracting larger insects to stop by and eat them. These larger insects then poop, providing the plant with nutrients. I think the lesson in all of this is that the world is both much more complex and much stupider than you can imagine. It's an elegant dance of pointless, sticky death and cherished bug shit.
