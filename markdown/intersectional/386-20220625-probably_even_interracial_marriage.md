# probably even interracial marriage

I'm sure people must be aware that all civil rights are on the chopping block: gay marriage, contraception, extramarital sex, probably even interracial marriage.

What you might not be paying attention to is that the ultimate project goes far behind the civil sphere. On the docket at this moment (West Virginia vs. EPA) is whether the government has the ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. This is part of a project to eliminate the regulatory state.

Expect the EPA, SEC, FEC, FDA, FERC, OSHA, and especially NLRB to be gutted. Speaking of the NLRB, labor rights are critically endangered. The past several decades have seen this fight accelerating (most recently in Janus v. AFSCME).

Expect them to overturn rights you take for granted: minimum wage, overtime, unionization, child labor laws, etc. It doesn't end there. Understand that there is no such thing as "settled law" in the eyes of this court or the fascists that put them there. Not even rights enshrined in the constitution.

Freedom of assembly, is of course a legal fiction, abridged at will by police. Freedom of speech is constantly touted by the fascists, but also constantly balanced against their conception of "speech without social value."

Make no mistake: freedom of speech to these people is something for corporations and fascists to enjoy, not you. Freedom of religion? That's explicitly the freedom to enforce evangelical Christian beliefs on others. No other religion has the freedom to express their beliefs, such as the Jewish belief that a fetus is not a person until the moment of birth. The framing of Dobbs v. Jackson as the culmination of a decades-long fight is misguided. It is one part of a broader coordinated strategy to utterly destroy the working class.

Do not be surprised by the continued advancement of fascism.
