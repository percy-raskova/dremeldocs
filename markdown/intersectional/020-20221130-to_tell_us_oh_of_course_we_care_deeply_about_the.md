The role of the WEF is to throw a "progressive" veneer on the fundamental issue that is capitalism. To tell us "Oh, of course, we care *deeply* about The Issues™️! We know the current system isn't working. Let's work together to come up with solutions."

https://t.co/m2ZBmlWgS1 Yes, infinite economic growth is a recipe for ecosystem collapse. That's obvious. What they leave out in this bedtime story is the *reason* the economy "must" grow infinitely; the accumulation of capital demands it. The drive for profit necessitates overproduction. Those capitalists who most ardently adhere to the principle of infinite growth are the ones who grow their own power. They outcompete the more modest, rational, empathetic capitalists. Moderation is a disadvantage in the capitalist world, and avarice is the driver of success. The only way to stop this is to eliminate the capitalist model entirely. The fundamental feature of capitalism *is* unchecked growth, and you can't reform away fundamental truths. Capitalism is incompatible with sustainability. It's incompatible with humanity.
