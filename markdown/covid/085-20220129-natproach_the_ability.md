# @natproach The ability

@natproach The ability to actually bind to and infect cells certainly places constraints on how the virus can mutate. My point is part of a larger model about the interplay between the virus and the immune response. Obviously humoral immunity fades over time. (1/?) @natproach So if you get vaccinated or infected, then get exposed again to the exact same strain 6 months later, the initial stages of the infection progress very similarly to naive individuals. You'll likely be fine due to later cell-mediated immunity, but you still got it. (2/?) @natproach Which means you also potentially spread it during that initial period (if you didn't get tested quickly and had the means to stay home until you were negative). The result might not be death, but the virus continues to bounce around in the population. (3/?) @natproach The same thing happens even if your humoral immunity is still online from recent exposure, but the virus infecting you is distinct enough (while still having the ability to bind ACE2 and enter cells). Again in this scenario, you give the virus space to spread and mutate. (4/?) @natproach So what I'm predicting is a scenario where there's a constant wave of variants that only need to be distinct from the most recent variant to escape that initial immune response. We could see variants surge, then go into hiding, then reemerge 6 months later. Forever.
