# The Soviets

The Soviets took a backwards, underdeveloped agricultural empire and transformed them into the first humans to leave this planet. We don't need to invent any absurd claims. https://t.co/zn0fKcvays Damn those awful Soviets! They cruelly hoarded all the wheels in Eastern Europe to invent their fanciful, steam-powered, star-skipping covered wagon!!
