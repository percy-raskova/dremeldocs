# the split happened because Mao saw Khrushchev as moving *...

@MaratLives Yep. And the split happened because Mao saw Khrushchev as moving *away* from that, in favor of trying to "appease capital."

I'm clearly more inclined to side with Mao on that, but the split itself was disastrous for the end goal of global communism. @MaratLives Again, I can't pretend to know what I would have done in Mao's place. I could *theorize* that there may have been a better way to convince Khrushchev to recommit, or finagle other leading Soviets, or whatever. But it's moot. It happened, let's learn from it, let's do better!
