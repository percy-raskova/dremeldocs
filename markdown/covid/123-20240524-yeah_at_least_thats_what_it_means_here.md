# Yeah, at least that's what it means here

@ghastlymilf Yeah, at least that's what it means here. Jews tend to clump up in clearly-defined communities for mutual support, shared venues, etc. If you're within the eruv, that's probably what he means. https://t.co/u2YD49zNLc @ghastlymilf It's a physical boundary that designates everything inside as a "semi-public/semi-private residence," like a shared courtyard for a group of apartments. This makes it ok to carry objects in "public" on the Sabbath. So it's a pretty clear boundary for "the local Jewish community."
