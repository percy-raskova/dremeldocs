# a monumental shift

We are seeing a monumental shift in the politics of COVID. The "activist" ecosystem is starting to embrace masking as an organizational default, in the same way chauvinism is decried as a matter of course. Obviously there's a long way to go (same as with chauvinism). But the excuses are increasingly being seen as weak and unacceptable by a critical mass of People Who Care. In a cultural milieu that denies the very existence of airborne transmission, this simple reckoning is huge.
