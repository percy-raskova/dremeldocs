# the US ruling class

@primarycatdad The biggest difference is that the US ruling class has spent the last 100 years refining and advancing, while US communists have spent that time retreating.

It's not impossible, but we have much more ground to make up than the Bolsheviks did when they started out. @primarycatdad And yet, we also have the benefit of an extra century's worth of lessons to learn. We don't need to reinvent the wheel, we just need to adapt and reattach it.
