# @bolshevikingr China

@bolshevikingr China did manage to make it work with keeping the last emperor alive, despite him trying to work with local warlords to get reinstated during the civil war and collaborating with Japan during WWII.

All it took was a decade of "reeducation" to turn him into a communist. @bolshevikingr But as we've seen throughout history, China has been able to do a lot of things that the west probably couldn't hope to try.
