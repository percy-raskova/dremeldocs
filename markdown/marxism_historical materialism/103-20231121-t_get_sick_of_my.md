# t get sick of my 

@FoxyMarxist Over the course of recent years, I have found my circle of friends naturally pruning itself to primarily include other neurodivergent people, who don't get sick of my "eccentricities." @FoxyMarxist I like to think of it less as "being an annoying autistic weirdo" and more of "selective pressure."
