# the anarchic, individualistic, "protests

We are a long way from the anarchic, individualistic, "protests" of decades past. This is a culture of discipline, which could easily be undermined by one opportunist salivating at the chance to be The Voice of the Movement -- but everyone prioritizes the movement over the self. https://t.co/oK40w2sUaY Obviously there is a tremendous amount of education yet to be done for the movement to fully mature, but by and large, we are ready to embark on that education.

Occupy is dead: outgrown, out-organized, outnumbered.
