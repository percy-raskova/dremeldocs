# still have n't heard any news of the status of @CDCDirector...

We still haven't heard any news of the status of @CDCDirector since she tested positive for COVID 9 days ago. None of the "Symptoms are mild, working from home" BS we hear whenever a prominent figure gets infected. I'm guessing there simply is no way to spin her illness as mild. Far from the liberal hand-wringing about "civility," I do want her to recover, but only for political reasons. I do NOT care about her personal health any more than she cares about the health of us unwashed masses. As far as I care, she can be on an iron lung forever. But if she does recover, after what is at this point CLEARLY a severe acute infection, it might signal the beginning of her actually taking this disease seriously. Maybe she'll become a crusader for actual public health, instead of "Wash your hands!"
 https://t.co/cuDBkX9RI6 Maybe she'll push for real measures, demand the Biden admin instate mask mandates, do media appearances to explain the actual science of the disease, put out more comprehensive coverage of case positivity, emphasize the critical need for prevention and detection, etc. Of course, in that case, she would likely be marginalized and pushed out of the administration. She'd be replaced with a more obedient spokesperson of COVID denialism. In which case, I would hope she becomes an independent voice screaming for us to take this seriously. Otherwise... she might not recover. She'll be quietly disappeared, with no media coverage or administration acknowledge of where she went. We'll continue marching blindly into the swarm of XBB, BQ.1.1, BA.2.75.2 and other immune-evasive variants. And many will follow in her wake.
