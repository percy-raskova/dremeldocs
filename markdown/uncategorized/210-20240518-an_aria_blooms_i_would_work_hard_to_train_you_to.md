# @An_Aria_Blooms I would work hard to train you to get...

@An_Aria_Blooms I would work hard to train you to get better, that way when I still continue to beat you, it's more satisfying. @An_Aria_Blooms No no sweetie, you should wait until I pass priority to you at the end of *my* turn to play that instant. Playing it now means going almost a full round with less available mana, which limits your ability to respond on my turn.
