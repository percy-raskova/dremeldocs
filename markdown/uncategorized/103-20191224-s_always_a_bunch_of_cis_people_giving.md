# s always a bunch of cis people giving 

@RaeRevived I get legitimately uncomfortable in spaces where people introduce themselves with their pronouns, because it's always a bunch of cis people giving "obvious" pronouns...

And then it gets around to me, and I'm the only "they/them." And I know they still see me as "he" anyway. @RaeRevived I get that they're trying to be inclusive, but it just puts me on the spot, and forces me to confront their initial expectations of me. So now, from sentence 1 out of my mouth, I'm the person everyone's looking at and scrutinizing. Even if they accept me, the self-doubt is there.
