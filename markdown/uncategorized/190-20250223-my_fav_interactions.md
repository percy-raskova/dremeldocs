# my fav interactions

One of my fav interactions with the lumpen of Baltimore was back when I very much did not "pass," but I was wearing a skirt, and clearly *presenting* feminine.

And this random dude passing by goes "'scuse me miss, wanna buy some piercings? I got good deals, anything you like." https://t.co/FWAFwoqWan When I said no (I have no piercings at the moment), he just went "alright have a good one!" and carried on his merry way. No rudeness or misgendering or slurs or violent lashing out. Just two people exchanging polite greetings and moving on with our lives.
