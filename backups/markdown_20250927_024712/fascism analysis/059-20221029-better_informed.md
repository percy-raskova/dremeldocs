# better informed

Communists are not "better informed" than "the masses." That's a meaningless concept. At best, we have a more rigorous analytical framework for *interpreting* the raw data held by our specific communities.

Lenin didn't know shit about 2020s Baltimore. Baltimore does. https://t.co/XJGhl3eWyS I say "at best," because some of y'all seem to not even have that analysis down, and operate purely based on vibes. No analytical ability AND no contemporary data.
