# @Rogpod13 Hmmm, yeah

@Rogpod13 Hmmm, yeah, I wonder why a communist party would be invested in the long and arduous process of educating the masses and engaging them in a fully democratic process to completely overturn centuries of regressive culture baked in from the era of imperial rule. @Rogpod13 Almost as if Marxism-Leninism is not actually rooted in the petty quest for personal power, subverting the people's  will to cement an unjust regime, but is instead a movement that works to transform society through the constant work of education and organization of the masses.
