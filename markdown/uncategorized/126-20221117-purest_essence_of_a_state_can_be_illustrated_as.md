# purest essence of a state can be illustrated as follows :...

The purest essence of a state can be illustrated as follows:

Two people sit at a table, a contract drawn between them. The rules of engagement, signed and dated, with mutual consent.

Pressed to the temple of one of the signatories is a gun. This is totally normal. Where did this signing ritual originate? At first, it was just a thief with a gun, mugging their victim directly. That evolved into a contract, to make the theft "official." The thief got tired of holding the gun, so they hired someone else to hold it for them. The thief then wrote philosophical treatises on how elegant and natural the whole system is. Perhaps they claim the gun was given to them by some divine force. Perhaps they claim the victim willingly gave them the gun. Perhaps the gun is proof of their innate superiority. Either way, the victim obviously cannot just stop signing the contract. They cannot dictate new terms. They cannot even refuse to uphold their end of this lopsided bargain. They cannot do anything without first seizing the gun. On this, Leninists and anarchists agree. Except anarchists seem to think the victim should just throw away the gun, without first drawing up a new contract, sitting the thief down, and reclaiming what has been stolen for centuries.
