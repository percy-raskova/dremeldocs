# m blocked too, and I hadn

@jewstein3000 I'm blocked too, and I hadn't even dug into the thread at the center of it. When Liz first messaged me about it, I had a LOT of nuanced thoughts, but the bottom line is basically: if you mass block people, you clearly have no interest in "protecting the movement from division." @jewstein3000 At this point, it should be pretty clear that the people saying "We can't let this divide us" are the ones doing the dividing. This is TRG all over again ðŸ™„
