# unchained corporate power

It is possible for a person to struggle to find common ground between unchained corporate power and the abolition of capitalism. Misguided, but still, a human impulse.

Finding "common ground" with the demons who salivate over a 10-year-old rape victim giving birth is not human. These are not people. They are incompatible with the very concept of being human. They deserve nothing but total destruction. And giving even a tiny bit of consideration to their perspective is inhuman too.
