Evidence for Uyghur genocide: some dude named Adrian said "just trust me bro."

Evidence for Palestinian genocide: Israel proudly posts War Crimes Supercuts https://t.co/HfYFrcS4gT https://t.co/fWNhVLwfme Gaza is a maze of rubble. The Zionists have destroyed every last hospital and university. 10,000 children have been slaughtered in 100 days. All of it, recorded and broadcast with pride by the perpetrators.

It is absolutely disgusting to even try to compare. Do these people not even stop to question why every institutional power in the west -- governments, think tanks, media outlets -- propagate the idea that Xinjiang is being genocided based off nothing, while denying the Palestinian genocide we can all watch in real time?
