# this perspective

@orbrealm I agree with plenty of this perspective, and you're right that some of it comes down to phrasing and what points I chose to emphasize. The topic of bourgeois political dynamics could be teased apart into such granular parts that a Twitter thread could simply never do it justice. @orbrealm My primary disagreement is the assertion that this is a *simpler* way of responding, because this contains much more depth (and obviously still leaves out plenty of nuance in itself).

I also think you're under-emphasizing just how firm a grasp finance capital holds.
