# Ukrainians spent 1,000 years murdering, raping, and...

Ukrainians spent 1,000 years murdering, raping, and stealing from my ancestors.

Then the revolution began, and the Ukrainian Army ramped up pogroms, slaughtering tens of thousands of Jews.

The communists won, and Yiddish joined Ukrainian and Russian as a state language. https://t.co/YGnzapPziC For the next several years, the communist government played whack-a-mole against pockets of organized antisemitic violence by the remaining reactionaries.

When the Nazis invaded, it was these "Ukrainian national heroes" who took up the cause of collaboration and genocide. That includes the man Ukraine now official holds up as a champion of Ukrainian national identity, Stepan Bandera, under whose leadership an estimated 700,000 Jews and 120,000 Poles were systematically murdered. The history of Ukrainian nationalism is a millennium of the most brutal antisemitic subjugation, interrupted only by the best efforts of communists -- a "crime" for which they become immortalized in the national memory as the greatest threat to Ukrainian sovereignty. In their eyes, Russia has become synonymous with that "oppression" -- the oppression of the oppressors -- despite the situation in both regions being very much the same. The national majority, whether Russian, Ukrainian, etc., having their supremacy stripped away by force. The only times Ukrainians have "fought for freedom and equality" have been Ukrainian communists fighting side by side with their cousins in Russia, Georgia, Belarus, etc. They fought AGAINST the nationalists, AGAINST the Whites, and AGAINST the Nazis.
