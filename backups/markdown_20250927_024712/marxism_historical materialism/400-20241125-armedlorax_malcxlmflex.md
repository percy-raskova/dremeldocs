# @ArmedLorax @malcxlmflex

@ArmedLorax @malcxlmflex It's a masturbatory fairy tale whose central theme is that imperial powers rose to dominance because of deterministic environmental factors -- and that the environmental factors he identifies *must be* deterministic, because otherwise how would those imperial powers have risen? @ArmedLorax @malcxlmflex It's full of factual inaccuracies, spurious sources (he literally cites the diaries of conquistadors as evidence of what transpired during their conquest), and circular reasoning. It scoffs at historical materialism in favor of a level of determinism on par with "God blessed us." @ArmedLorax @malcxlmflex My favorite bit of nonsense is his notion that indigenous peoples couldn't build up population density because they didn't have enough domesticable species available -- despite the dozens of species they DID domesticate, and the concept of "domesticable" being, again, circular.
