# still have n't read everything Lenin wrote 

I still haven't read everything Lenin wrote. I read the core texts, but I like to parcel out the various other writings because they read like the most hilarious, petty Twitter threads.

"Since we have Mr. Tugan to deal with, we shall have to start with the rudiments." "When professors set out to refute socialism, one never knows what to wonder at most--their stupidity, their ignorance, or their unscrupulousness."

"Political equality is a demand for equal political rights for all... who don't suffer from liberal-professorial feeblemindedness."
