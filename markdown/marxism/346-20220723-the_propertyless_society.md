# the propertyless society

@Ezra_EX @yeongno3 We are not living in the propertyless society I described, so of course there's still unproductive labor.

Labor whose purpose is maintaining/expanding property relations--such as police, banking, or in this case, helping companies find workers--is a *cost* capitalists pay. @Ezra_EX @yeongno3 You seem to be conflating productive labor in the capitalist context with what it "inherently" is. From the Marxist view, no labor is naturally productive: it is socially defined and evolving. To the capitalist, productivity relies on capital expansion. We are not capitalists. @Ezra_EX @yeongno3 The idea that baristas are not "productive" doesn't make sense for a capitalist society, where they are clearly performing an act of transforming an input into a good to be exchanged on a market for surplus value.

However, it also doesn't make sense for a communist society. @Ezra_EX @yeongno3 Baristas produce something which society deems useful. People enjoy coffee. It's not necessary to survive: neither is art, food that isn't purely for nutrition, clothes beyond a burlap sack. We do things as a society that enhance our enjoyment of life. @Ezra_EX @yeongno3 The labor involved in these things aren't "unproductive" just because they don't produce a commodity that can then be fed back into another productive process. They are socially productive, because they add to a society in which people have a reason to want to live.
