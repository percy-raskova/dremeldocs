# my second COVID infection

I think it's safe to say at this point that my second COVID infection has had a significant neurological impact on me. I've always had some issues with focus, but now it has gotten completely ridiculous. I haven't been able to really sit down to write since that infection. It's been 2 years since the first infection, which left me with chronic fatigue. I'd often have days in a row where I couldn't get up for more than a few minutes at a time. I think I've actually seen improvement on that front, and haven't really had an episode in months. But now my thoughts have become disjointed. I have trouble staying on topic, recalling small details, starting and finishing tasks, and fully elucidating my thoughts in a succinct and clear way. I still have my analytical ability and creative heft -- I haven't become "dumber." But I struggle to focus, more than ever. I have an almost-complete article that I've been sitting on for months, that I keep delaying the final steps for. Any time it occurs to me to sit down and write, the drive just slips out of my mind. Tasks have become too slippery to hold. I have a dozen "most important thing for me to write RIGHT NOW" concepts floating around in my head at all times, the theses fully formed in the abstract soup of my mind -- but I can't focus for long enough to put them on paper. I owe myself four or five theoretical treatises. I'm not really sure what to do about any of this. This thread is another of my rambling, disjointed thoughts. At least I wrote it down.

Don't get COVID, kids. And don't tolerate roommates who will inevitably give it to you through their own recklessness.
