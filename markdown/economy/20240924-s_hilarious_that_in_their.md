# s hilarious that in their 

It's hilarious that in their "voter outreach" crusade, Democrats find themselves needing to present an ever-more apocalyptic vision of a Trump presidency. They cite all the different groups that Trump will relentlessly persecute, then finish off with "And therefore... VOTE!" "Trump will criminalize trans people and ban abortion starting at conception and deport millions for 'seeming too Mexican' and start a nuclear war with China and--"

HOLY SHIT, that sounds terrible! How are we going to stop it??

"We're going to file a formal complaint!" And what if he wins anyway?

"Well... then more people should have voted!"

Ok, but say they didn't. Trump is elected. What do we do now?

"Protest in the streets! Tell him very loudly that we don't like him!"

Ok, check. He now knows we don't like him. Now what? Apocalypse time? "Then we spend the next 4 years making sure more people vote next time--"

Isn't he going to be a dictator? What if there is never another election?

"All the more reason to vote now!"

Ok, and if we fail, and democracy ends?

"Then... we... Uh..." You can't say a Trump presidency would be SO MUCH WORSE than a Harris one that it doesn't matter that she supports genocide... and then do nothing. You can't tell me that, as a trans person, my life would be forfeit under Trump, but that we can't do anything about it except vote. If I were to suggest to these liberals that, in the face of such a threat, the solution is to preempt the threat -- for the sitting president to send troops to grab him and detain him indefinitely without trial, or for a paramilitary to launch a coordinated assassination -- -- they'd say that's not how we do things in a democracy. That violence solves nothing. That we'd be just as bad as Trump. That we can't defend the rule of law by breaking it. And on and on.

All I hear is that they value "the rule of law" more than they value my life. They value the purity of the concept of democracy more than they value my life or the lives of any of the other people whose identity they weaponize. If the law said they had to report any "queer activity" to the SS, they'd do it in a heartbeat.

Because that's the law.
