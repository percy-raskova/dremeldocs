# @DecolonialMarx Comparative genomics

@DecolonialMarx Comparative genomics between modern domestic and extant wild species puts maize domestication around 9-10k years ago.

That's different from *cultivation*, which is probably about as old as humans encountering it in the first place. @DecolonialMarx And it's also different from the *start* of the domestication process, which obviously predates the final qualitative leap by a wide margin.
