@KatyMontgomerie The key here is that they actively research this stuff. They do focus groups, air segments in small new markets, etc. They compile the results of their spray and pray tactics, see what riled people up the most, and then use that language to manufacture outrage. @KatyMontgomerie "Critical Race Theory" (another Chris Rufo invention) was deliberately crafted this way. So was "groomer," "cancel culture," and the subversion of "woke."
