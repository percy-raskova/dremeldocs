# Whoa, there

*comparing a bullet and a bullet hole*

"Whoa, there's no way this is a coincidence; someone must have designed this bullet to fit in *exactly* this hole!

And I know who did it: the commies!" https://t.co/CRgGXZrxIE (Just so there's no confusion, I am saying that the selective pressure on a virus to bind to its target is akin to the force of a bullet punching through balsa.)
