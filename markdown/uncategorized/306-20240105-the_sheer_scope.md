# The sheer scope

The sheer scope of ecological disruption done to grow vegan staple crops is astronomical. So many animals suffered, way more than honey bees, to get you that soy. Even if it's "organic" or "fair trade" or whatever other buzzword: the cultivation itself necessarily displaces. https://t.co/FN2hFIs23K *Of course* there are ways to make sure your consumption habits have *less* negative impact on animals. But honey is quite literally the most ethically neutral product I can think of on that front, other than scavenging for yourself.
