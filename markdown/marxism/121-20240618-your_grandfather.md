# your grandfather

Wow, that's so interesting about your grandfather! Hey, out of curiosity, which "Armenian Army" was he in while he was fighting against the 11th Army of the Soviet Union? Was it, by any chance, the Armenian Legion, a part of the Nazi war machine? ðŸ¤” https://t.co/XRHyk0Fz3u (By the way, Armenia was another case of a 25 to 1 ratio of people joining the Red Army rather than the Nazis. But I'm sure those hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers just didn't love their homeland as much as the 12-30,000 Nazi collaborators, right?)
