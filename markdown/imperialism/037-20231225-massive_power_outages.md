# massive power outages

Via RNN:

"Settlers are reporting massive power outages in large parts of occupied Palestine. All of occupied Asqalan has lost power, as well as vast areas in the west, up to 'Tel Aviv,' 'Netanya,' and occupied Haifa, as well as parts of the south." "Several settlements in northeastern Palestine near occupied Safad have also lost power.

Zionist sources suspect a massive cyber attack."
