# @zack_breslin @MARKBEVIS3

@zack_breslin @MARKBEVIS3 The author also rounds out this Malthusian argument by basically saying "We might be tempted to blame fascists, but actually, it's everyone's fault. We need to work together."

The phenomenon being described, of blaming a malignant other, *is* fascism, and it's already here. https://t.co/b7UKinNryh @zack_breslin @MARKBEVIS3 Fascism is not a blameless identity group, in danger of being scapegoated to avoid addressing the real issues. It is the defense mechanism that protects dying capitalism. Identifying the *actual* enemy is not a threat to "working together," it's a precondition for doing so.
