# the Actually Existing Democratic Government

I love watching liberals twist themselves into knots trying to explain how we need to vote for Democrats to stop all the bad things from happening, and yet the Actually Existing Democratic Government can't keep one single solitary man from being unjustly murdered by the state. One man. A single human being. Do you know how easy it would have been for THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON IN THE COUNTRY to save him? And you expect anyone to believe these ghouls will save everyone else on the chopping block??
