# The vomeronasal organ

The vomeronasal organ, responsible for detection of pheromones in other mammals, has been consistently demonstrated to be non-functional in humans. Developmentally, morphologically, and genetically, across a range of populations, it is either absent entirely or vestigial. https://t.co/nMn8JKlpNp In cadaver studies across age groups, the VNO has been found to be most likely to even be present at all in infants, and even then it is tiny. Genetic studies have found high rates of variability in genes that, in other animals, are conserved and expressed highly in the VNO. This indicates that these genes are non-functional: if they did something, they would be conserved. The same is true of the wide variability of morphology across individuals. Think of wisdom teeth -- in any given person, they can be full size, smaller, or never form at all. Of course, the main reason to not believe that humans can detect pheromones is simply that scientists have been studying it for a long time, and have never been able to conclusively demonstrate pheromone sensitivity at all. None of this necessarily indicates that it's *impossible* for *some* humans to have *some* pheromone sensitivity. But if they do, it would be the ones who: 1) actually have a VNO, 2) actually express functional receptor genes, and 3) the effect would be miniscule. This is the general rule when it comes to highly-studied phenomena: if we've been searching for it, and we can't find it, that means any effect it might  POSSIBLY have is non-obvious and niche. If it's hard to prove something is happening, that means it is rare, minimal, or both.
