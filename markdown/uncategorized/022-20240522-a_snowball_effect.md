# a snowball effect

@Rocko64_ There definitely is a snowball effect, where being unable to do stuff makes you feel even worse about yourself, and so being able to actually do that stuff contributes to feeling better. But obviously that doesn't mean you can just... decide to improve. @Rocko64_ To extend the broken leg analogy, your leg muscles WILL atrophy while you're laid up, and once you start to recover, it's important to deliberately combat that -- but it's not really up to you when and even IF that becomes possible. And trying to force it just fucks you up more.
