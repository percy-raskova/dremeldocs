# s right that Democrats aren

@BenjaminPDixon She's right that Democrats aren't doing right here. That's exactly why my friend, fellow teacher, union activist, and Democratic Socialist, Franca Muller Paz, is running for Baltimore City council as a Green candidate.

https://t.co/XsU5CX7cjx @BenjaminPDixon I was skeptical at first that she could win as a third party, but this campaign is ðŸ”¥. We have over 200 volunteers, we're about to hit $40k in donations (https://t.co/yF7xPYbARQ), and we're committed to building a network of trained political activists from among the community.
