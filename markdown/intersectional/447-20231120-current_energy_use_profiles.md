# current energy use profiles

@QuinnCat13 With current energy use profiles and animal cell based-meat production methods, the environmental impact is several times MORE than that of conventional beef production.

https://t.co/c9bMuRTgtR @QuinnCat13 It's a really complex issue to accurately assess environmental impacts of such a novel process, given that the technology is not set in stone and the industrial supply chains necessary to economically sustain it within a capitalist framework don't exist. @QuinnCat13 Rest assured, the environmental impact will only INCREASE as capitalists figure out how to extract profit from the emerging industry. Capitalism is reliant on the exploitation of cheap nature, and it cannot create new profit without ramping up that exploitation. @QuinnCat13 In other words, low-impact lab-grown meat would be cool, but we will need to overthrow capitalism to get it ðŸ«¡
