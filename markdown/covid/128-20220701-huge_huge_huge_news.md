# HUGE HUGE HUGE NEWS

HUGE HUGE HUGE NEWS!

This study looks at a specific antibody that is able to effectively target and neutralize the virus that causes COVID-19... AND related viruses!

This could lead to a vaccine that *actually* prevents transmission, and works for all variants, past and future! https://t.co/gPlK2kp8pU The antibody itself is very effective at both preventing and treating infection, which can give us a useful therapeutic strategy.

But more importantly, that antibody targets a section of the spike protein that has very, very little chance of mutation. Other *species* of coronaviruses have a very similar sequence, and so far all SARS-COV-2 variants seem to have *exactly* the same sequence.

So why haven't we targeted it for vaccines before? We didn't know antibodies could even reach it! It's usually tucked away inside the spike protein, where antibodies can't recognize it. Researchers believe it reveals itself during a crucial step of the virus trying to get into your cells.

They only found it when they studied the blood of a patient who recovered from COVID.
