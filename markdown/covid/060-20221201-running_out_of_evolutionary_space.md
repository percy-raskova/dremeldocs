# running out of evolutionary space

Anyone who tries to sell you the theory that SARS-CoV-2 is "running out of evolutionary space" is either a fool or a charlatan. https://t.co/LwwnKo9IMn Executive summary: the virus is quite easily able to evolve to evade immunity without losing its ability to infect cells, because it constantly racks up multiple mutations that compensate for each other.
