# the words "burger

Did you know that the words "burger" and "bourgeoisie" come from the same etymological root: burg, meaning town.

"Burger," short for hamburger, i.e. "from the town of Hamburg." It's unknown if the initial use "Hamburger steak" actually refers to the burger being invented there. https://t.co/R1Pf8bgl88 The bourgeoisie, back in the day, were an emerging class of town-dwellers, distinct from feudal lords, the serfs that worked their land, or the free peasants. They were artisans, craftspeople, traders, bankers, etc. They began accumulating wealth and power as feudalism waned. Over time, more and more serfs were enticed to move to the burgs to work for wages, rather than continue to toil for their lords. The emerging bourgeoisie became more organized into a political force, pushing for liberalism and the end to aristocratic privilege. Wherever they emerged victorious, the bourgeoisie cemented themselves as the ruling class, transitioning economies from feudal to capitalist rather rapidly. They solidified their social position, and today the struggle between bourgeoisie and proletariat is at its height.
