# specifically A Liberal

@fembrute I'm definitely not calling him specifically A Liberal. I'm not exactly a devoted consumer of his work, so I'm not really making a serious evidence-based argument here ðŸ˜… It's mostly just a vibe I get. I plan to check out more of his work soon. @fembrute I fully admit to mainly just wanting to use the phrase "infected with liberal particles," and assuming any streamer must have some liberalism in their heart.

(And also wanting to head off any weirdos yelling at me for being too supportive of someone I'm not super familiar with.)
