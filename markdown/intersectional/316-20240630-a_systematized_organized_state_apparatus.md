# a systematized, organized, state apparatus

I have no idea what version of State and Revolution this person is reading, but it can't possibly be the one where Lenin very explicitly talks about a systematized, organized, state apparatus for the violent repression of bourgeois resistance. https://t.co/Thl3vcYRmQ https://t.co/HlU925UBql Yes the police should be abolished. Yes, oppressed classes should be armed. And yes, those armed classes should be regimented into a state apparatus capable of retaining their class dominance over their old oppressors, until those oppressor classes have been eradicated. The proletarian state -- specifically, its need for organized repression of counter-revolutionary organizing -- is "temporary" on the scale of history. Unlike bourgeois states, the goal is not endless expansion, but rather accomplishing a specific, achievable goal. But we obviously can't put a timeline on that, or even expect it to be achieved within our lifetime. In the same way that you can't put a timeline on eliminating cancer from the body; it requires an ongoing campaign of seeking out and destroying every malignant cell.
