# the correct position has the future

@Rocko64_ This idea of "the correct position has the future" is the core of my stance on how to deal with many incorrect left tendencies. I think they're wrong *because* I think they cannot win. If they *do* end up winning, I was wrong about them. @Rocko64_ Obviously, this doesn't apply to "left" deviations that are actively trying to create something we're explicitly opposed to. We don't underestimate or form united fronts with chauvinists, for example.
