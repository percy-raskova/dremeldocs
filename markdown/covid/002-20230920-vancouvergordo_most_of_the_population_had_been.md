# @VancouverGordo Most of the population had been vaccinated...

@VancouverGordo Most of the population had been vaccinated by January 2022. The rate has only ticked up by a few percentage points since then. So that is not the difference between this year and last year.

In addition, the vaccines are targeted to old versions of the virus, and are obsolete. @VancouverGordo The number of people in the US who even bothered to get the bivalent booster (offering protection against BA.4/5, which is now also obsolete), is less than 25% of the population. The upcoming booster is targeted to XBB.1.5 -- again, this is now 10 months out of date.
