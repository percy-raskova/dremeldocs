# a deadly contact poison

@brianrkramer Last night, I carefully applied a sealant on my lips, then added red lipstick laced with a deadly contact poison. I batted my eyes at capitalism, and sauntered over with a sultry gaze. As the clock struck midnight, I pressed my lips to capitalism's, and said "Happy new year." ðŸ’‹ @brianrkramer As capitalism slumped to the ground, the last thing it saw through blurry eyes was the look of smug contempt, as I wiped the lipstick from my mouth with a monogrammed handkerchief.

I let the kiss-stained cloth flutter gently to land on capitalism's chest as my calling card.
