# the autoimmune registry

Something that may have slipped under your radar: a few days ago, the autoimmune registry added COVID-19 to its list of autoimmune diseases, under the "unconfirmed" category of how much evidence we have to link the disease to downstream effects.

https://t.co/QxlINNvGn6 The evidence for post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) being an autoimmune disease has been mounting for a while, including:

- The persistence of innate immune inflammatory response.
- The particular symptoms of the disease.
- The prevalence of myocarditis in COVID patients. - The depletion of na√Øve T cells during/following acute infection.
- The sharp increase in autoantibodies in COVID patients.

There have been other clues, including the higher prevalence of PASC among women (who are more likely to develop autoimmune disorders). (Side note: although there is some evidence for autoimmune disease being somewhat related to X-linked genes, there is also evidence for sex hormones playing a role. Trans women are more likely to develop certain autoimmune diseases than trans men or cis men.) Although the autoimmune model of PASC progression hasn't yet been conclusively proven, the signs are clearly there. It's yet another nail in the coffin of the disastrous and genocidal "let 'er rip" plan.

I've said it before, but it bears repeating: ALL of this was preventable.
