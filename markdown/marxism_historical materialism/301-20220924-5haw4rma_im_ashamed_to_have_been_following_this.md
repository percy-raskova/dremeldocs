# @5HAW4RMA I'm ashamed to have been following this person

@5HAW4RMA I'm ashamed to have been following this person. I think she must have had a good take at some point, and then I kept following her out of guilt, to prove to myself that I could tolerate "religious Marxists." @5HAW4RMA Of course, why should *I* be the one to find common ground with someone who says "fuck atheists"? Should have been a forewarning that she'd have a take like "Khamenei is actually good, because the CIA doesn't like him."
