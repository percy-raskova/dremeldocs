# @ethan_k_eblg It definitely depends on *why* you're...

@ethan_k_eblg It definitely depends on *why* you're canvassing. In general, canvassing, especially door knocking, is a liberal tactic, useful mainly as "spray-and-pray" for getting people to take some small, non-disruptive action, like voting or signing a petition. It's sales, not organizing. @ethan_k_eblg Canvassing CAN be a useful part of a larger project, including as a tool for social investigation, making community members aware of services your org provides, inviting people to community meetings, etc.

When used to build community and organizational power, it's not liberal.
