# ve ever had and I literally can

I have the highest paying job I've ever had and I literally can't afford housing anywhere near my job. If I took a job closer to where I live, I wouldn't be able to afford housing here.

Joe Biden just decided to add $250 in student debt payments to that death spiral calculation. https://t.co/5OaRgTBcI5 "Inflation has gone down" in the same way that a car speeding down the highway, after reaching 100 mph, might stop accelerating quite as quickly. That doesn't mean it has slowed down at all, or even *stopped* accelerating. It's still going dangerously fast. And in fact, every Serious Economist™️ assures us that the *worst thing* we could possibly do would be to slow down -- that would basically be the same as going backwards!

Also, it's suuuuch a shock that we somehow keep crashing every 6-10 years or so. So crazy. So unavoidable.
