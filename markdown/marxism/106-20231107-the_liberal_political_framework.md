# the liberal political framework

The greatest sin you can commit in the eyes of a liberal is divestment from the liberal political framework. There is no "negative externality" that can overcome the inherent moral failure of simply refusing to accept the invulnerability of bourgeois hegemony. https://t.co/9QVpf6QJID Liberal mythology grows weaker by the day, and it scares them. Blood and soil mythology is stronger, and they are increasingly willing to rely on that. Expect "genocide is not a deal-breaker" to morph into "genocide is the best option to preserve our way of life."
