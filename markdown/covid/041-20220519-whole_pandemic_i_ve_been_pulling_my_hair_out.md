# whole pandemic , I 've been pulling my hair out trying to...

@wsbgnl This whole pandemic, I've been pulling my hair out trying to get people--rational people, who generally trust my perspective--to understand how bad things are.

Their perspective is always "Well, it can't *possibly* be that bad! Everything's open, I'm vaxxed, I mask..." @wsbgnl Even rational people can't truly internalize just how much ground has been abdicated by governments and public figures. They might even have a healthy distrust of authority, and *still* take it for granted that the overwhelming messaging around them *must* be somewhat true.
