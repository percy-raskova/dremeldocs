# much more leeway

The context for this is during a discussion of education, and how students are being stretched thin by studies and need to be given much more leeway, both in and out of the classroom. He even mentions *reading for fun* as something kids should have ample time for. https://t.co/WQYPXoI20l He also shares my overall philosophy of pedagogy: give students questions in advance; do they can study them, assess their ability to explain in their own words, not rote recitations; let them collaborate openly instead of "eyes on your own paper," etc.

https://t.co/AwkUG0erpV Essentially, stop treating students as an enemy to interrogate. Education is collaborative and creative. Placing all these undue restraints breeds stress, resentment, and staid thinking.

That's what he meant by the harm of "reading too many books."
