# s basically the only place where I encounter people who don

I spend so much time on Twitter because it's basically the only place where I encounter people who don't think I'm crazy for understanding COVID and refusing to participate in this mass disabling event. Except Twitter is also the perfect place to be dealt a daily barrage of psychic damage by people who think Starbucks workers are bourgeois, and working at War Crimes Inc. is trans liberation.
