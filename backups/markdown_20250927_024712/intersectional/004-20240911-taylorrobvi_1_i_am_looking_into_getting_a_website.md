# @TaylorrObvi 1) I am looking into getting a website up and...

@TaylorrObvi 1) I am looking into getting a website up and running, because it definitely sounds like people would appreciate that.
2) Without launching into another long thread, the shortest answer I can give is that liberalism is the multifaceted political philosophy of the bourgeoisie. @TaylorrObvi One of its core tenets is the concept of the nation as a unifying web of social interactions to bind the different classes into one economic project (i.e. capitalist production). "We are English" as the baseline of social life, *before* "I am proletarian." @TaylorrObvi This concept of nation-as-society places economy as simply one aspect of social life *within* the nation. And as you can imagine, that framework is also the bedrock for the existence of national chauvinism to exist in the first place. @TaylorrObvi So liberalism invents the bourgeois nation as the basis for both exploitation of the working class *within* the nation and expropriation of those *outside* the great-nation (i.e. the particular nation that is defined by the bourgeoisie that cobbled together said nation). @TaylorrObvi And then fascism runs with that invention, ramps up the expropriation, cloisters the central hegemonic national ideal from the countervailing drive toward assimilative pluralism (yet another topic that needs its own thread), and regiments the already-existing hierarchy.
