# @Ed2BeFree @AshleyEsposito_

@Ed2BeFree @AshleyEsposito_ I agree with this take. It shouldn't fall on parents, students, and teachers to make themselves into public health experts: they should be able to trust the people in charge to make the best decisions on their behalf.

Participation comes in the form of sharing your worries... @Ed2BeFree @AshleyEsposito_ ... and having those worries seriously addressed.

If district leadership was interested in actually keeping people safe, they would have fielded those concerns over virtual and worked together to come up with solutions.

Instead, they just hand down decisions from on high.
