# the establishment

@LimeHatGuy The whole point of the post is that the only reason we have no power is because the establishment feels like they can jerk us around as much as they want, which is only true as long as we listen to them when they tell us to vote for the lesser of two evils. @LimeHatGuy Every time we fall in line, the GREATER of two evils feels more confident in being an even bigger evil than last time. So the bar for being less evil gets even lower, and the establishment Dems can put up an even shittier (yet still less shitty than the GOP) candidate.
