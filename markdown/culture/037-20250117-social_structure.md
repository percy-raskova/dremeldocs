# Social structure

@probablykaffe Well, yes and no. Social structure *is* reflective of biology (for example, prides do not take the social structure of an ant colony, since they reproduce differently, occupy different ecological niches, etc.) Behavioral and biological traits evolve based on each other. @probablykaffe Evolution involves changes in populations to fit the environment -- but those populations are also *part* of the environment, and for social creatures, it's a HUGE part of it. Social evolution is faster than biological evolution, and can therefore be a driving force for it. @probablykaffe A great example is some varieties of leafcutter ants, which socially developed agriculture. They collect pieces of leaves to feed their cultivated fungal crops, which they then harvest and consume. Over the course of this social transition to reliance on cultivated fungus... @probablykaffe The ants *biologically* evolved to become better at digesting the fungus, secret chemicals to protect it, and notably, morphological variations for different social roles specifically suited to their agricultural lifestyle.

The fungus itself also evolved in this context.. @probablykaffe ... to the point where the particular strain that the ants grow cannot survive in the wild. They literally domesticated a crop and built their civilization and their bodies around it!
