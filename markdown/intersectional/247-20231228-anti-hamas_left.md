# anti-Hamas left

There is no "anti-Hamas left." Palestinian Marxist organizations are engaged in armed struggle alongside their comrades in Hamas, PIJ, and others. You don't know better than them, you are just a chauvinist who wants nothing but a more even distribution of the spoils of empire. https://t.co/oTi4pGmmR4 Projecting a pathetic western "peace" fetish, to the exclusion of any active resistance, onto this kid is bizarre. He's young, and he has done and said nothing other than "I will not participate in genocide, even if it ruins my chance to reap the spoils." Maybe he'll decide he'd rather join the ranks of the "gentler colonialism" crowd. Maybe he'll defect and join the resistance. Maybe he'll engage in displaced, isolated adventurism against the state. Maybe he'll look to build a life elsewhere. We don't know. He's 18.
