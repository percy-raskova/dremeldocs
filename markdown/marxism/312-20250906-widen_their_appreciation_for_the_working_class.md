# widen their appreciation for the working class

My favorite part of that ACP blue color LARP post is the phrase "widen their appreciation for the working class," implying that these guys are ritualistically playing at labor to aesthetically appeal to "noble savages," like politicians wearing hard hats for campaign videos. Other favorite part is the guy showing someone how to pull a tape measure and saying "Another thing you can do to make sure it stays in place, you can put your foot on it, and there you go" and the guy looking on with amazement, going "That is so convenient ðŸ¤¯" These people have never done even a minor home repair. Never hung up a shelf, never assembled furniture, never patched up clothes, never used a tape measure.

I'm far from being some butch fix-it gal, but these people are so sheltered they don't know how to swing a hammer. And what's the rationale for this "training"? Per the video, it's so they can perform renovations on their own "homes and businesses" without "breaking the bank."

This isn't about being able to provide decommodified housing. It's about people with money being able to save money.
