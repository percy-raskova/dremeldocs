# d be such a simpering doormat that I wouldn

@katewillett 1. Marry the lib because he'd be such a simpering doormat that I wouldn't have to change my life at all.

2. Kill the dirtbag leftist before he joins Patriot Front to "own the libs."

3. Fuck the YIMBY, because they're a rich bitch and probably have great post-sex snacks. @katewillett "Sweetie, I don't think it's fair that I have to do all the chores."

"What are you gonna do, vote about it?"
