# t know me super well is decrying the tendency for 

Apparently the "theory" I am most well-known for among people who don't know me super well is decrying the tendency for "armchair radicals" to try speaking revolution into existence with grandiose declarations.

Also known as Michael Scott Praxis. https://t.co/mivWmQmE1N Michael Scott-ism can take many forms, but in the most general sense, it involves (typically Marxists, but also anarchists and other tendencies) making statements, demands, and exhortations of an imagined "audience" of "the masses," without that audience actually existing. If your boisterous and inspiring statement is targeted at "the people," and you can't picture exactly who among those people is listening and ready to follow through, you're just Declaring Revolution™️ and expecting results to manifest out of thin air. I don't mean "what type of people," I mean *actual specific people*. Names, faces, needs, abilities. You don't have to know every single person, but you can't even rattle off a list of people outside your org who are even *seeing* to your statement, let alone taking it seriously. Revolution is not won by acclamation. A stirring speech given to a crowd of faceless plebes will not magically trigger them into action. These connections are hard-fought, forged in the crucible of material struggle.

Your organization needs to be an institution.
