# @Convict_No9653 China

@Convict_No9653 China seems to be at an ideological crossroads right now. This is the sentiment I have heard from 2 (out of 1.4 billion!) Chinese citizens. It is not the job of western communists to make the determination of the CPC's "purity." The bottom line is that they're doing a lot right. @Convict_No9653 If Xi's rhetoric is to be taken at face value, it's only going to get harder and harder to be a capitalist in China. But I think a lot depends on the geopolitical. If we really want to free China to be "more pure," it's our job to destroy the US empire.
