# @moghilemear13 That article is from 2014

@moghilemear13 That article is from 2014. IWI was given a contract to develop and manufacture a modified version of the Galil. It became standard issue, and was produced domestically at Z111 Factory.

Since 2019, Galil production has been replaced with STV, with no economic link to IWI. @moghilemear13 All that aside, yes, it's very childish the way people naively swallow the anti-China pill so hard that they imagine China is the Big Bad of Social Imperialism or whatever nonsense they construct to put a "leftish" spin on US state propaganda.
