# the great things

@redryder1 One of the great things about that phenomenon is that the alienation and self-serving attitude CAN be fixed by mere exposure. The necessity of accepting help from others, learning not to be snooty or bitter about it, having your cold, ladder-climbing heart melted by kindness. @redryder1 It's not a done deal obviously, and many of these people just end up entrenching further in the bourgeois mindset "to survive" (which obviously does NOT help them survive). Same as people who came up poor and harbor aspirations of purely self-serving "bootstrapping."
