# @Dr_Marxist_27 I feel like people saying this stuff simply...

@Dr_Marxist_27 I feel like people saying this stuff simply do not know what "lumpen" means. They don't know what the people are like, they don't know how diverse the entire class is, etc. They just read "lumpen are counter-revolutionary" from texts written by others who were just as distant. @Dr_Marxist_27 Their revolutionary framework is built on theories crafted by people in completely different contexts, and now have no idea what revolution looks like if not "a bunch of factory workers beat their hammers into rifles and march into the winter palace." @Dr_Marxist_27 Here and now, it's not the industrial proletariat or the peasantry who will build the revolution. It's the people hustling and squatting and rotating in and out of jail and cobbling together whatever they can to survive.
