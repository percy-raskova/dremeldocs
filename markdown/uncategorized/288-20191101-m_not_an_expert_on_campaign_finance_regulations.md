# m NOT an expert on campaign finance regulations, but I

@Joshua4Congress I'm NOT an expert on campaign finance regulations, but I'm pretty sure it's perfectly fine to use campaign funds to pay yourself a salary during the campaign. @Joshua4Congress But then it's still a gamble for working people to run, because you need to--while still working--raise enough funds quickly enough to be able to survive the campaign once you transition to campaigning full-time. If you don't, your campaign dies because you just cannot afford it.
