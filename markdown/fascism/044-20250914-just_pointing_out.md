# just pointing out

@rednewafrikan I hate when people are "just pointing out" things that are "inarguably correct," while washing out the sheer scale of those things' social context. It's true for "colonized men do patriarchy," it's true for "AI uses lots of energy," it's true for "Blackstone hoards housing," etc. @rednewafrikan It's "sharks attacks" political analysis. Sharks injure less than 100 people per year and kill almost no one, but they're hyped up as these dangerous monsters because of the shock value. You're literally more likely to be killed by furniture.
