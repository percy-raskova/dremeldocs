# this so many goddamn times

I've commented on this so many goddamn times already, yet here I am, once again. Like Sisyphus, my toil never ends. Just because education is captured by capital for the purpose of furthering its hegemony doesn't mean education itself is evil. https://t.co/selupeS0qL Every liberation movement in history has fought tooth and nail for the right to education. Ask yourself honestly: why does the *actual* authoritarian regime we live under RIGHT NOW actively sabotage the schools of the most oppressed people?

https://t.co/vNIS2hnoVM Obviously, none of this is going to convince you if your main concern is people being "free" from the "authoritarian" practice of teaching them how to liberate themselves. Oppressed people teaching themselves how to learn, how to teach, how to fight.

https://t.co/K1ExTfH4HA Ironically, it doesn't actually matter if we can convince the more anarchistic elements of the importance of education. Because by embracing education ourselves, we inevitably out-organize them.
