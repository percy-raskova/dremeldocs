# such a bleak ideology

Liberalism is such a bleak ideology. Can you imagine living life like this? Constantly running on a treadmill that crushes humanity into grist, and being thankful for it. Caping for the demons who deny us the stuff of life: the freedom to cook, to bathe, to see the sun. https://t.co/O9CwicNlQv Our task as communists is trivial. Everyone can see plain as the daylight these ghouls call an amenity how devoid of humanity the current economic system is. We have vanishingly little convincing to do on that front. Our only job is to show them exactly how we take back the sun.
