# My favorite board game

My favorite board game is the one where you gather stuff, then use the stuff to build things, then use the things to gather more stuff. My favorite video game is the one where you build things, then use the things to to gather stuff, then use the stuff to build more things. My favorite tabletop rpg is the one where my friends and I have to put on a play about cheese, to cover for a lie we told a cheesemonger months ago, which we had to do to acquire a giant wheel of cheese for important plot reasons.
