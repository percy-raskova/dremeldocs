# s translation of Curriculum of the Basic Principles of...

From a Vietnamese HS history textbook (via @LunaOi_VN's translation of Curriculum of the Basic Principles of Marxism-Leninism):

"The petty bourgeois class includes: intellectuals, scientists, and small business owners, handicraftsmen, doctors, lawyers, and civil servants. (1/8) The vast majority of contemporary intellectuals before the August Revolution of 1945, including students, belonged to the petty bourgeoisie. In general, they were also oppressed by imperialism and feudalism, often unemployed and uneducated. (2/8) The petty bourgeoisie were intellectually and politically sensitive. They did not directly exploit labor. Therefore, they easily absorbed revolutionary education and went along with the workers and peasants. (3/8) However, the intelligentsia and students often suffer from great weaknesses, such as: theory not being coupled with practice, contempt for labor, vague ideas, unstable stances, and erratic behavior in political action. (4/8) Some other petty bourgeoisie (scientists and small businessmen, freelancers, etc.) were also exploited by imperialism and feudalism. Their economic circumstances were precarious, and they often found themselves unemployed and bankrupt. (5/8) Therefore, the majority also participated in and supported the resistance war and revolution. They are also important allies of the working class. In general, these members of the petty bourgeoisie had a number of weaknesses: (6/8) Self-interest, fragmentation, and a lack of determination.

Therefore, the working class has a duty to agitate and spread propaganda to such members of the petty bourgeoisie, organize them, and help them to develop their strong points while correcting their weaknesses. (7/8) It is necessary to skillfully lead them, make them determined to serve the people, reform their ideology, and unite with the workers and peasants in order to become one cohesive movement. Then, they will become a great asset for the public in resistance war and revolution." (8/8) [NOTE: This analysis is particular to the conditions of Vietnam, and is only generalizable to the extent that *specific* fractions among the petty bourgeoisie exhibit similar tendencies. In the US, the majority of the petty bourgeoisie do not align with working class interests.] [NOTE (cont.): There are many reasons for this, many of which also apply to the US working class writ large, given their position within the empire. However, both "petty bourgeois" and "settler working class" are categories that warrant in depth analysis beyond a twitter thread.]
