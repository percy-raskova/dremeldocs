# the natural end result

@Rocko64_ It's the natural end result of the perpetual cycle of boom and bust caused by the tendency of the rate of profit to decline. Historically, those who tether their capital investments to technologies that slowly become obsolete inevitably lose out during the "rebuilding" stage. @Rocko64_ The constant advancement of the financial capital apparatus (including state complicity) has allowed an ever-growing sector of the capitalist class to essentially untether themselves from the industrial world, and secure their prospects no matter the material conditions. @Rocko64_ So every recession, more of the market space is gobbled up by financial capital, while large swathes of industrial capitalists lose out and are forced to adapt by investing in expensive new technologies or get pushed out of the realigned market.
