# @lovemoz1 Transmission

@lovemoz1 Transmission is when the virus finds a new host. That's exactly what I'm describing here: vaccinated people who get infected can still infect  others. Many other diseases are blocked from doing this by vaccines, which allow your body to react quickly to infections before they @lovemoz1 can multiply to the extent where they can infect new hosts.

SARS-CoV-2 is able to evade that for a number of complicated biochemical reasons that mitigate that rapid immune response.
