@m1vql1hdwt I think this is mainly a disagreement in how we're defining the concept of knowledge. I'm not interested (in this context) in knowledge as a static resource to accumulate, but as a constant flow of perceptive signals which must then be interpreted (and reacted to). @m1vql1hdwt I think the type of knowledge you're talking about is akin to memory (short-term, long-term, episodic, procedural, semantic). In my original point, I was more talking about basic sensation and perception dynamics--which are required for forming those memories in the first place. @m1vql1hdwt So of course you're correct that communists should be gathering as many of those data points as possible from our community, synthesizing them with our broader historical memory, building our understanding, and in doing so, acting as the memory hub of our society. @m1vql1hdwt But in the context in which I was speaking (a comrade discussing building common lexicon with the community), my point was that it is impossible for us to separate that pursuit of understanding if we view our knowledge-seeking as even *possible* to be separate from the community.
