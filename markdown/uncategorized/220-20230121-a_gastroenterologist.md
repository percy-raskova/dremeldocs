# a gastroenterologist

@comrade_eagle I would not recommend that at all, because I am not a gastroenterologist. But in general, trying to clear out your microbiome is not a good idea. The gut flora you naturally cultivate help protect against pathogenic bacteria by outcompeting them before they can get a foothold. @comrade_eagle So if you have a persistent viral infection going on and especially one that screws with your immune system (like SARS2 does), you need all the help you can get.
