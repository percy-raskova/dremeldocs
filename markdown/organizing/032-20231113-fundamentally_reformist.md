# fundamentally reformist

@peakcapitolism @femalehysteria @fugalise My point in calling DSA "fundamentally reformist" is in identifying that the primary aim of the organization itself is to do the exact opposite of that. The dominant tendency is not simply ineffectual, incoherent liberalism to be swayed, but explicitly liberal ideological actors. @peakcapitolism @femalehysteria @fugalise It *seems* like the organizational goal of MUG is to undo that trend through raising its profile among the rank-and-file membership. Which is all well and good, as far as that can go. But you cannot ignore the deep entrenchment of liberalism at the very base. @peakcapitolism @femalehysteria @fugalise I absolutely support that effort. I simply have no illusions that it will lead to a shift in the character of the organization itself. Rather, I see it as the best way to actually unite those that can be united, and form the core of a revolutionary party. Like the Bolsheviks did.
