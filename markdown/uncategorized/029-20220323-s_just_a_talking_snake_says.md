# s just a talking snake) says 

@theserfstv Yup! The story of the garden is that Adam and Eve were told not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, because it would give them knowledge on par with God. Satan (in the original Bible, it's just a talking snake) says "That's not fair! You should do it anyway!" @theserfstv The name "Lucifer" literally means "light bringer," because he gave humans the light of knowledge.
