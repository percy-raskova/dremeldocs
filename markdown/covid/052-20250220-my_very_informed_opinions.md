# my VERY informed opinions

I'm sick of people who know infinitely less than me about COVID trying to dismiss my VERY informed opinions.

Don't talk to me if you can't tell me which SARS-CoV-2 protein downregulates MHC-II to mediate immune evasion.

Or which word in that sentence is intentionally wrong. I like to phrase it like that so you can't just pop off a quick Google search. You'd have to actually read at least a few lines of a to figure out what's off. And then you might accidentally learn something ðŸ¤”
