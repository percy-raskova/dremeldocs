# s be perfectly clear: if you aren

Let's be perfectly clear: if you aren't providing a service to the community, you aren't building anything. You're just proselytizing, hoping random passersby will be caught up in the Holy Spirit and join your little Bible club. https://t.co/mKh5aDDZbz Are movements built solely on charity or mutual aid or survival programs or whatever else you call your acts of service? Of course not. Just like a forest isn't grown with just soil. You need light, water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, phosphorus, pollination, seed dispersal... But even if you have all those things available, you cannot plant an acorn on unyielding rock. The ground must be made soft and fertile. You need a place to put down roots. You need to be materially enmeshed in your community.
