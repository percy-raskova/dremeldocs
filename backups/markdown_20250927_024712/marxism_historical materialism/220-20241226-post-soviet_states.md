# post-Soviet states

Life expectancy in post-Soviet states plummeted 10%. Poverty increased tenfold. Children became prostitutes, widows became homeless, national industries became playgrounds of oligarchs.

The west was pleased.

Then Russia began reversing those trends, and became the Boogeyman. https://t.co/GwXwtcQIcL The clear dividing line between "Let us welcome our new capitalist brethren!" and "This is Real Life Mordor and it must be destroyed" was the renationalization of the Russian oil industry.
