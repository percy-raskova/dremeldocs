# were just fishing because I posted a picture of Joe Biden...

I'm fine. They were just fishing because I posted a picture of Joe Biden with a red triangle over him ðŸ¤£ Oh and of course the fact that they've clearly looked all over my Twitter tells me the gratuitous misgendering in the conversation was deliberate. But par for the course, obviously.
