# Today I got some topsoil delivered to cover the gravel in...

Today I got some topsoil delivered to cover the gravel in my yard. They couldn't fit the truck in the alley, so I had to go back and forth hauling one wheelbarrow load at a time. This random guy sees me struggling from across the street and runs up to help me out. https://t.co/JqpRkwBDa9 While he's hauling, and I'm spreading it out, an older gentleman walks by. Turns out he's a general contractor with 48 years of experience, and now HE'S helping too! He gave me advice, laid a pipe to direct rainwater, packed in dirt to block rats from nesting under my porch, etc. I made two new friends today, and will definitely be calling on them when it's time for our organization to start fixing up all these houses. There's a lot of energy and talent and eagerness to help in these streets. Just a genuinely amazing place to live. There's not a lot we can't do when we band together. I can't wait to see this city truly flourish 🥰
