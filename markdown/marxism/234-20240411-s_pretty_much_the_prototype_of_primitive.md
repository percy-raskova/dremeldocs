@DecolonialMarx It's pretty much the prototype of primitive accumulation*, the capture of EXISTING resources under the banner of capital -- which by definition is not "progression of productive forces." In the same way that people moving from one place to another is not a "population increase." @DecolonialMarx *I'm not really a fan of the term "primitive accumulation," which implies that it's some sort of long-distant, one-off event, rather than an ongoing process necessary for the maintenance of capitalist relations.
