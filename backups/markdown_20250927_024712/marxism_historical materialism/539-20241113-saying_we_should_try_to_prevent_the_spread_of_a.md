# Saying we should try to prevent the spread of a deadly and...

"Saying we should try to prevent the spread of a deadly and disabling disease that the capitalist state demands we ignore is the REAL counter-insurgency!"

- Guy who is a paragon of free thought and revolutionary vigor https://t.co/6r63mkdgsq I don't know how much clearer we can get, after 5 years of this. If you think COVID magically disappeared or stopped being a threat when the bourgeois regime decreed it so, you are beyond gullible and have nothing to add to the movement until you learn some critical analysis. Imagine referring to anyone mentioning climate change as agents of "CLIMATELPRO." Or believing that about the Palestinian genocide or mass incarceration or queer persecution or any of the thousands of other manifestations of the hegemonic structures that reinforce the empire. Of course, I say that as if it's a given that some vague, western "leftist" actually cares about any of those things.

I'm not even talking to this guy. I doubt there is any chance of him being convinced that his entire way of life is constructed to keep the world in chains. The sad truth that those of us who actually seek liberation need to contend with is that those with a material investment in the status quo -- even those who believe it's in need of some repair -- also have an interest in skirting around "troublesome" analysis. Even under bourgeois cultural hegemony, there are thresholds of acceptable rebelliousness, such as those on display by "COVID is over! Medicare and unions for all!" DSA types. Pressure release valves, to allow you to feel radical without the threat of revolutionary mobilization. And there can be no revolution without understanding and tackling these myriad, existential issues. Those who feel the crush of violent repression in their daily lives are more likely to begin the necessary analysis. In the case of COVID, that's typically disabled people. Although in this case, even more so than with other contradictions of the capitalist regime, it is alarmingly easy for someone to *become* part of the cohort which feels the threat most saliently.

I even wrote a little something to help you learn more:

https://t.co/SCcNg6WSLi But this isn't even a question of "how does this affect me personally?" It's the fact that that question is even being asked that's the problem. It affects *us*. The collective of all the various classes that capitalism actively oppresses, in wildly varying degrees. If you want to consider yourself part of the movement to liberate those classes, you need to be actively rooting out and destroying the liberalism in your mind. You need to be constantly subjecting everything you thought of as "common sense" to the harshest inquisition. Otherwise, you are not a part of the revolutionary movement. And if you're not on the side of revolution, you are its enemy. Every excuse you make for maintaining even a sliver of the regime puts you further in the camp of the enemy.

You are dancing outside Gaza.
