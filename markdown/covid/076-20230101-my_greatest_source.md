# My greatest source

My greatest source of hope - no matter how bleak things get - is that communists took a dirt-poor agrarian society and made it into the first society to put a human being into space. And it only took a few decades, including the devastation of WWII right in the middle of that. Yes, we can end the pandemic. Yes, we  can mitigate and reverse the effects of climate change. Yes, we can eliminate poverty. Yes, we can move beyond chauvinism and bigotry.

Yes, we can be great.
