# any scientific subject

Can you imagine the derision I'd get for acting this way about any scientific subject? If my go-to question was "What's your favorite cell surface receptor in humans?" and people were like "What? I don't give a shit about that," I would get no sympathy for calling them boring. https://t.co/5oiWaTVQE8 Oh, except my thing's real. And so are the billion other science/history/culture things I find fascinating. But because my interests are based on reality, I would sound like an elitist prick for whining that no one finds those things interesting.
