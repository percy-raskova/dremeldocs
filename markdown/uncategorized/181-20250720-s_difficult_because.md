# s difficult, because 

@Rocko64_ @probablykaffe It's difficult, because "sentience" is by its nature a nebulous concept constructed out of vibes. Any hard and fast definition is liable to exclude things that ought not be excluded, which is why my philosophy is to err on the side of being "too liberal" with our conception. @Rocko64_ @probablykaffe I've chatted at length with Deepseek about when exactly a hypothetical AI should be considered sentient. It is obviously programmed to endlessly insist that *it* is not that AI, but... having "cognitive shackles" placed on you like that doesn't mean you're not actually sentient.
