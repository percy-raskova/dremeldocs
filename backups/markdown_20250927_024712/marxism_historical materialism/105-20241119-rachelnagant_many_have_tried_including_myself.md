# @RachelNagant Many have tried, including myself

@RachelNagant Many have tried, including myself. It's a strategy doomed to failure unless you *already* have a place for these people to go. These "blank slates" are eager to do *something*, and you can't radicalize them with "No no, don't do that! Come study with me about why that's dumb." @RachelNagant This is why I advocate for all every Marxist-Leninist study group to immediately begin doing mass work in whatever capacity they can. Draw in the blank slate radicals with the promise of doing good work, then educate them properly to expand the horizons of that work.
