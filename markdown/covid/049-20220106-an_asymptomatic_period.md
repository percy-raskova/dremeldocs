# an asymptomatic period

@shane__lewin @SingerNickT @hjelle_brian Correct, but my point is that COVID has an asymptomatic period where it's still highly infectious. Even if at the onset of symptoms, people dropped dead, if they can spread before that, the disease can spread, just *less* than if it's completely nonpathogenic. @shane__lewin @SingerNickT @hjelle_brian The later in the viral life cycle it becomes dangerous enough for people to stop spreading it, the less of an impact that dangerousness has on the course of evolution. Since COVID kills late into infection, *after* people have done the spreading, it can always get more lethal.
