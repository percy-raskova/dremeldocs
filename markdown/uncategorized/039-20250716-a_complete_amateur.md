# a complete amateur

@rednewafrikan I've been saying for a long time that Stalin is absolutely NOT the authority on the nation, and anyone blindly citing him is revealing themselves as a complete amateur. @rednewafrikan I don't really think he's DISASTROUSLY wrong. I just think it's a facile conception, like the earliest days of genetics research. No serious modern biologist is citing Mendel.
