# no useful definition

There is no useful definition of "stick" that excludes bamboo. A stick is just a thin piece of wood, typically understood as being fallen or harvested from a tree.

"Tree" is surprisingly difficult to rigorously define, but generally we think of a tall, perennial, woody plant. https://t.co/WquHtQR2gD Tall? Bamboo clears that easily.

Perennial? Yup, bamboo persists through the seasons.

Woody? Here it's more open to interpretation. Bamboo is made of cellulose and lignin -- the composition of wood. Most bamboo are specifically "woody," as opposed to the herbaceous species. Bamboo is certainly more woody than other things we commonly call trees: banana trees, papaya trees, Joshua trees, etc. All of these are distinctly herbaceous -- their growth is supported by thick, non-ligneous fibers. In terms of chemistry, a piece of bamboo is just as much of a stick as a branch with its bark stripped off. In terms of biology, there is no universal definition that excludes bamboo. In terms of application, you can use a piece of bamboo exactly how you would a stick. In fact, a stalk of developed, woody bamboo easily surpasses the vast majority of sticks in usefulness. It's straight, thick, strong, durable, and versatile, in ways some random twig you found on the ground is unlikely to measure up to.

Happy sticking everyone!
