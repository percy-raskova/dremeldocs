# look at how Nazis did it

I did, in fact, "look at how Nazis did it." I actually studied it for over a decade.

Somehow, I must have missed the part where their victims had constitutionally mandated apportionment in government, autonomous regions that receive preferential allotment of development funds... https://t.co/73jaVT9HiO ... strict laws preventing hiring discrimination, legal protections for use of their own languages in official capacities, lower thresholds for admittance to universities, priority for housing in new urban developments, lower taxes, increasing rates of interethnic marriage, etc. The Nazis also never said "Whoaaa guys, Aryans are having wayyyy too many babies. For now, only one baby apiece. Except Jews -- you guys can as many babies as you want."

This is straight up Holocaust denial. Every time you say the phrase "Uyghur genocide," a Nazi gets its wings.
