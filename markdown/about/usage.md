# Usage Guide: Wielding Revolutionary Theory as a Weapon

## The Purpose of This Archive

This is not a museum. This is an armory.

Every thread preserved here represents theoretical ammunition developed through struggle, refined in the crucible of organizing, tested against the reality of revolutionary practice. You're not *browsing* an archive - you're accessing the collective memory of a movement that understands theory as a guide to action.

## How to Use This Theoretical Arsenal

### Navigation as Political Education

- **By Theme**: Each thematic category represents a domain of struggle. Navigate them not as academic topics but as battlefronts in the war against capital.
- **By Tags**: Tags aren't keywords - they're the connective tissue of revolutionary thought, linking seemingly disparate struggles into unified understanding.
- **Search**: Full-text search enables rapid deployment of theoretical resources in active debates, study groups, and organizing conversations.

The organization itself teaches: how imperialism connects to pandemic politics, how fascism analysis illuminates cultural criticism, how every domain of struggle is interconnected through the material base of capitalist exploitation.

### Citations: Arming the Movement

When you cite this archive, you're not performing academic courtesy. You're building chains of revolutionary knowledge, creating traceable paths through which comrades can follow theoretical development and sharpen their own analysis.

**For Study Groups and Political Education:**
```
@BmoreOrganized. (Year). "Thread Title." DremelDocs Revolutionary Theory Archive.
Retrieved from https://percy-raskova.github.io/dremeldocs/
[Include theme classification for political context]
```

**For Organizing Documents:**
```
Source: @BmoreOrganized via DremelDocs Archive
Theme: [Political Economy/Fascism Analysis/etc.]
Revolutionary Context: [How this analysis serves current struggle]
```

Citations aren't about attribution - they're about *reproducibility of revolutionary knowledge*. Every citation is a breadcrumb that helps another comrade find the theoretical tools they need for their local struggles.

### Contributing: Building Collective Capacity

This archive lives because the struggle lives. Your contributions aren't charity - they're revolutionary labor.

1. **Corrections as Sharpening**: Submit corrections not for accuracy's sake but because precise theory enables precise action. Misunderstanding breeds opportunism.

2. **Enhancements as Collective Development**: Suggest improvements that make this knowledge more *weaponizable* - clearer for study groups, more accessible for organizers, better structured for political education.

3. **Translations as Internationalism**: Translation isn't just language conversion - it's breaking the Anglo-hegemonic stranglehold on revolutionary theory, building genuine international solidarity.

Every contribution strengthens our collective theoretical capacity. This isn't peer review - this is collective self-defense against ideological disarmament.

## Technical Infrastructure as Revolutionary Practice

### The Stack as Political Choice

- **Generator**: MkDocs with Material theme - Static sites resist corporate platform capture and surveillance
- **Classification**: Custom NLP pipeline with Marxist vocabulary extraction - We build our own tools because the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages - Using capital's infrastructure against itself, maintaining portability for when we must move
- **Source**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/percy-raskova/dremeldocs) - Fully open, fully reproducible, impossible to memory-hole

These aren't just technical choices. This is digital guerrilla infrastructure - lightweight, portable, reproducible, and outside the direct control of surveillance capitalism. Every architectural decision prioritizes longevity of revolutionary memory over convenience or aesthetics.

### Why Local Processing Matters

The classification pipeline runs entirely locally - no cloud APIs, no corporate ML services, no data leaving your machine. This isn't paranoia; it's understanding that every API call to corporate infrastructure is potential surveillance, that dependence on cloud services is dependence on capital.

We process 21,723 tweets into 1,363 classified threads using *our own* computational capacity because controlling the means of analysis means controlling the products of that analysis.

## On "Intellectual Property" and Revolutionary Knowledge

This archive preserves public political speech for the continuation of revolutionary struggle. The original tweets remain attributed to @BmoreOrganized not as property but as *political genealogy* - understanding where ideas developed, in what context, through which struggles.

We reject the entire framework of "intellectual property" as bourgeois mystification. Ideas aren't property - they're weapons. And weapons belong to whoever needs them in the struggle.

This compilation exists because:
- **Memory is a battlefield** - Capital wants us to forget our victories, our methods, our martyrs
- **Theory deteriorates without preservation** - Platforms die, accounts vanish, but struggle continues
- **Collective knowledge requires collective infrastructure** - We cannot depend on capital's platforms to preserve anti-capitalist thought

## A Living Document of Living Struggle

This archive will grow because the struggle grows. It will change because our understanding deepens through practice. It will spread because revolutionary knowledge, like revolution itself, cannot be contained once it takes root.

Every time you use this archive - whether citing in an organizing document, sharing in a study group, or consulting during ideological struggle - you're participating in the construction of revolutionary counter-memory. You're refusing the amnesia capital imposes. You're insisting that we remember not just what happened, but *why* it happened and *what must be done*.

The archive is yours. The knowledge is ours. The struggle continues.

## Technical Preservation Note

Full source code, classification algorithms, and complete reproduction instructions are available in the repository. This ensures that even if every platform fails, every host disappears, every corporate service denies us - any comrade with basic technical knowledge can resurrect this archive from source.

*That* is resilience. *That* is revolutionary infrastructure. *That* is how we ensure that the theoretical weapons forged in struggle remain available for the struggles to come.
