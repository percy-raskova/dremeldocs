# ever more productive labor

@Rocko64_ By stratifying its population into classes, it becomes possible for a society to extract ever more productive labor out of the exploited classes. The exploiters are thereby able to accumulate resources much faster than societies in which there is a relative lack of this coercion. @Rocko64_ When capitalists claim that "human nature" prevents communism from being productive, they mean humans naturally do not want to vastly OVERproduce, the way we are forced to do in class societies. We produce more than we need to reproduce our labor, but not to our own detriment. @Rocko64_ And those societies which do not evolve into class forms obviously get "naturally" outcompeted by those which do. Cruelty is very productive.

Over time, that exploitative social order comes to predominate. It feels "natural" only because it tautologically reinforces itself.
