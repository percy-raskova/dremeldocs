# Germany's Army High Command

@Rocko64_ Have you ever read the war journal of Franz Halder, chief of staff of Germany's Army High Command during the invasion of Poland? He is constantly expressing his annoyance at the Soviets blocking them from steamrolling the entire country. @Rocko64_ 15th September: "[Warsaw] must be starved into capitulation! We are in no hurry and don't need the forces now outside Warsaw anywhere else."

17th September: "Report that Russia has started moving forces across the frontier. Our troops must halt on the line Skole-Lwow!" @Rocko64_ On the 20th, he calls Russia "Liberators of Lwow" and calls it a "day of disgrace for German political leadership." This, in regard to a previous note that, if Russia stands their ground, they are not to advance. "Keep distance of 10 kilometers."
