# all the BPP's successes

@rednewafrikan For all the BPP's successes, they clearly did not have it all correct, because they were defeated. No matter how great the opposing force, the correct strategy is whichever overcomes it.

Doesn't mean there's nothing to be learned from them, just that we need to a critical eye. @rednewafrikan Basically, this. Either critically analyze what was wrong or remove yourself from any conversation about revolution, since you think it all comes down to luck of the draw, that the only path to success is your enemy happening to fail at stopping you.
