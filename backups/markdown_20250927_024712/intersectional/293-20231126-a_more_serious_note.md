# a more serious note

@Rocko64_ On a more serious note, this is actually a separate strain of fascism from Nazism. It's more in line with early Italian fascism, Austrian fascism, and others. Whereas the Nazis pioneered a more supranational orientation, a tradition that has been carried forward by the EU and US. @Rocko64_ I intend to explore this line of analysis more in a fuller treatise. I think it's crucial for understanding fascism to recognize the two opposing strains and the separate geopolitical aims. We're seeing a resurgence of the "revanchist" strain in opposition to the "supranational."
