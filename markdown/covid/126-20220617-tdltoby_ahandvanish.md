@Tdltoby @ahandvanish Yeah, I think the pathway could easily be:
virus -&gt; inflammation to deal with the virus -&gt; amyloid to repair inflammation damage -&gt; plaque buildup -&gt; neurological effects

Also explains why diseases like Alzheimer's tend to come late in life: slow buildup of plaques over time. @Tdltoby @ahandvanish Which could indicate some virus that sticks around, causing constant need for more amyloid ðŸ¤”
