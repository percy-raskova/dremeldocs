# the power building

@trustpunch @cat_portfolio Damn it, I forgot to price out the power building! That costs extra, as we all know. @trustpunch @cat_portfolio But in all seriousness, it actually does, because it means UPP members will be more likely to actually engage with DSA and vice versa. It provides a crucial service to the community, who will, again, be more amenable to working together in the future. Etc. Etc.
