WE HAVE OUR ORDERS. ü´°

There are two very specific types of operation, laid out for us by the PFLP, that we, in the West, should be taking:

- Blocking the embassies of Israel and the US.

- Blocking the shipments of the tools of Zionist imperialism from Western ports. I should probably mention that "we have our orders" is, of course a rhetorical device. I have never been in contact with any organizations designated as a "foreign terrorist organization," and if I had, I certainly wouldn't be bragging about it on social media. Stay safe ü´° There are other actions available to residents of other parts of the world, such as blocking Middle Eastern fossil fuel exports to the imperial core. But these two tactics are what we can do from inside the belly of the beast. And they were chosen deliberately. All of these tactics together comprise an overall strategy of materially and politically isolating the Zionist regime, simultaneously raising the cost of defending it and lowering the benefits for the empire, as well as scuttling communication between puppet and puppet master. This is the scientifically-informed strategy presented to us by Palestinian Marxists, chosen because of their empirically sound analysis of "Israel's" relationship to the US global empire. It exists as an outpost, unable to sustain itself alone.

https://t.co/DQRY4JOh4U "Israel" is a money sink for the empire. It's a capital investment that continues to yield profit, but it must be maintained with a constant supply of fresh materiel, labor, logistical support, etc., and must constantly justify its value to empire with a return on the investment. The order to focus on embassies is designed to hamper coordination and negotiation between empire and subject -- every subject. In the Middle East, the goal is to cut off the US and "Israel" from collaborationist governments and drive an end of normalization. This drastically diminishes the gains made by the empire for having its colonial outpost. (It also lays the groundwork for further revolution by the working classes of those nations to end the collaborationist regimes -- something "Israel" has consistently aided in averting.) Similar goals are accomplished by the blockading of oil exports, but in a more immediate, acute style. A war on multiple -- but not every -- front, as the international resistance builds organizational and tactical maturity.

For us in the imperial core, the tactics are flipped. We are the ones positioned to attack the propping up of "Israel," again, through the ports and the embassies. Where the Arabic resistance is directed to drive down the benefits of empire, we are directed to drive up the costs. That requires very targeted, coordinated operations. The emphasis on the *shipment* of weapons and other tools of empire, and not the manufacturing, is deliberate. The empire has limitless facilities for the manufacture of military tech. Most production has nothing to do with "Israel," and is not in the purview of this campaign. It would be nice if we could simply shut down every facility, scuttling the entire military industry, but we aren't even *close* to having that capability. We can't even properly shut down ONE! If we had the ability to shut down production, we'd already be engaged in revolution. Shipment, however, is targeted. It's a lot simpler to plan and execute a blockade operation. It's still difficult, and still requires depth of organization many of us currently refuse to learn. But it is absolutely within the capacity of our nascent movement to learn to do it. Every shipment departs from a specific choke point and has a specific destination. By the time ships begin getting loaded up, we can already *know* where the weapons are headed. If they're headed for the occupation, they're a productive target. Our purpose in engaging with this campaign is not to act as mild nuisances, flies for the empire to swat down. We need to be regimented, a fighting force that consistently drives up the cost of empire, in coordination with the rest of the international resistance. We cannot achieve this with sporadic, ill-prepared adventurism that goes against the strategy of the campaign planned out by our comrades in the PFLP. We should not presume to know better than them, the ones practiced in revolution: treat them as your commanding officers.
