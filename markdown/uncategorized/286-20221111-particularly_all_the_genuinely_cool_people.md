# particularly all the genuinely cool people

I would miss Twitter if it became unusable--particularly all the genuinely cool people I interact with regularly. It's way too many people and the relationships are often too casual for me to justify establishing external methods of staying in touch. It would be like if one day, all the neighbors you say hello and briefly chat with disappeared. Except for me, those neighbors happen to all be scientists, artists, activists, and generally interesting people. We share opinions, joke, philosophize, plan real-world actions, etc. I've gotten better at screening out the brain-melting nonsense. I don't engage with the drivel, except to mock it with my Twitter neighbors. I'm spending less time doomscrolling and finding reasons to get mad. It would be a shame to lose it right when I'm getting good at it.
