# s by 0.5, multiply Sanders

Whatever the numbers are, multiple Biden's by 0.5, multiply Sanders' by 0.75. Those reflect the proportions of their voters that will "definitely vote for" in the primaries. Iowa:
Sanders: 19.5%
Biden: 12.5%

NH:
Sanders: 16.5%
Biden: 7.5%

Nevada:
Sanders: 14.5%
Biden: 12.5%

South Carolina:
Sanders: 11.25%
Biden: 16% Based on those numbers alone, here are the delegate totals they can be *sure* of going into Super Tuesday:

Sanders: 23
Biden: 20
