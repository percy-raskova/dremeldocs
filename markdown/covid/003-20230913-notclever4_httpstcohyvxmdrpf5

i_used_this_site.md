I used this site. $15 for the consultation, where a chat bot walks you through all the relevant information they need. Then an actual human looks over it and sends the prescription to your pharmacy. Super cheap, easy, and fast. @NotClever4 Honestly, even if you aren't experiencing symptoms, I would just lie, so you can take it as quickly as possible, before the virus can get a foothold.
