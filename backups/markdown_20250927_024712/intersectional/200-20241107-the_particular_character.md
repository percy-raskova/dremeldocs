# the particular character

@Dr_Marxist_27 Sooo... yes and no.

More yes than no, but it *heavily* depends on the particular character of which gangs we're talking about, and above all, the level of organization *we* already have, as Marxists, by the time we can even consider attempting to act in a unifying role. @Dr_Marxist_27 That is, gangs unifying in support of an increasingly militant and popularly supported communist organization is absolutely in the cards. But some sort of adventurist entryism attempt is doomed from the start.
