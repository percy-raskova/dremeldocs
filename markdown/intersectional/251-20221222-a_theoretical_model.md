# a theoretical model

@Rocko64_ I've been trying to work on a theoretical model to describe the mechanics of the construction, maintenance, and constant remodeling of hegemony throughout history. "Abolish" as a slogan ignores the ways every successful death and rebirth of social forms has addressed old forms. @Rocko64_ We want to reimagine society, which necessarily involves shifting the ways people internalize established social relations. We can instantly end *policies* and *practices*, but not imagined truths. We can only work to reshape these notions of what is and ought to be. @Rocko64_ Even something as obvious (to us) as abolishing slavery did not happen in the U.S. with the stroke of a pen. It took years of culture-crafting, a war, reconstruction, and never truly materialized: slavery never ended--both in prisons and in the minds of white supremacists. @Rocko64_ Over and over, revolutions have succeeded where they organically changed the character of social relations, and failed in arenas where they tried to skip to an imagined end goal--such as trying to repress religion outright instead of crafting an acceptable alternative.
