# s not just to 

It's not just to "make a couple of rich, bloodthirsty donors happy." The occupation of Palestine is the crown jewel of the American empire: the crack in the spine of pan-Arabism, the laboratory of counter-insurgency, the open spigot of fossil energy driving the engine of capital. https://t.co/zZUGqNuXBV Democrats and Republicans alike understand this intimately. They haven't been corrupted or misguided: they are actively pursuing the material interests of the empire of which they themselves are fully integrated, ideological actors. The ONLY way they will pivot away from "Israel" is when they believe that the central role it serves has become obsolete. It's unclear what it would take for that shift to take root, but it won't be a reflection of vague "public opinion," which has never guided imperial policy.
