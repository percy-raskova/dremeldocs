# a "natural" saris

@transjewtalian I studied the Talmud extensively when I was younger, and yes, a distinction is made between a "natural" saris and a "manmade" saris. Although iirc it's presented not as "elective," but a result of intervention for a life-threatening condition (e.g. testicular cancer). @transjewtalian It's definitely not about a "male who later develops female characteristics" or vice versa. It's about *not* developing male characteristics (saris) or female characteristics (aylonit). Or at least, it wasn't presented that way to me within a pretty regressive culture.
