# social democrats

If you are earnestly trying to do any sort of revolutionary organizing and it's not working, the problem is not other tendencies. It's not the fault of Trotskyists or Stalinists or Maoists or anarchists or social democrats or red-brown fascists.

The problem is you. What *you* are doing isn't working. Plain and simple. If it was working, we'd see it.

There's no point whining about how all those misguided others are diverting the working classes with their failed ideologies. *You* are the one who's failing to fulfill *your* ideological aims. You think your ideology is the correct one? The path forward runs through your organization?

Great! Prove it.

If your tactics are failing -- which they demonstrably are -- then either you're not properly implementing your ideology... or you have the wrong ideology altogether. Either way, the solution is the same: you need to thoroughly reexamine your practice. Study, plan, experiment, adjust, repeat.

Spend less time worrying about the people and organizations you know are wrong. Focus on what *you* are doing wrong. Keep your eyes on your own paper. Orrrrr maybe you haven't given it enough time, and you should just keep trying the same tactic. It'll have to work eventually, right??
