# overt cultural maneuvering

The entirety of global geopolitics is a function of centuries of the dominance of capital, propped up by state violence to subvert sovereignty and bolstered by overt cultural maneuvering to manufacture consent. The main reason I'm not an anarchist is because I understand this pattern. If you don't have the structure of state power, you will be undermined and conquered by those who do. This will always be true for as long as capital exists anywhere in the world.
