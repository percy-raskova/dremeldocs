# Masks are good for individuals, but not for populations

Fully in line with liberal brainrot: "Masks are good for individuals, but not for populations," as if the population isn't made of individuals. All public health measures contracted down to some things being presented as "smart ideas" in "certain contexts." https://t.co/ab5nXaeW0Q Masks don't "blunt waves without stopping them," they SAVE LIVES you ghoul! The end result of "personal responsibility public health" is expecting hundreds of millions of people to individually come to the correct decision amidst a mountain of mis- and disinformation. The number of people in the West who:

1) Know that masks work
2) Know which masks to wear and how
3) Know that "wear a mask" does not mean taking it off once you're seated at a restaurant
4) Know the local case rates
5) Even know COVID is still an issue

is vanishingly tiny. "[X measure] is good, but you don't have to do it if you don't feel like it" is just about the dumbest "public health" message that you could construct.

It's like saying "2 + 2 *technically* equals 4, but we won't mark you wrong for giving a different answer." Individuals are not scientists. They're not public health experts. They're not glued to what little COVID news gets published. They need to be given solid, actionable, no-bullshit truths. Stop playing the nuance game with a deadly, disabling, society-rending disease.
