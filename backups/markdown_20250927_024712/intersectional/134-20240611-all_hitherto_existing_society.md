# all hitherto existing society

First line: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles."

Second line: clarification that "class struggle" refers to "in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another". https://t.co/HLJLzTIHCn The only "US exceptionalism" at play is the belief that, of all the colonial projects in human history, the US is the only one that has magically eliminated settler-colonial as one of those oppressor-oppressed relations around which the axis of history revolves.
