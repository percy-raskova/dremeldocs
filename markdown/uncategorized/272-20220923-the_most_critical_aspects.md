# the most critical aspects

@comrade_pabs One of the most critical aspects to scientific pursuit is TIGHT control over your operating conditions. To interpret the results correctly, you need to be sure that you're measuring what you think you're measuring. You need to eliminate any possible confounding variables. @comrade_pabs The greatest scientific failings throughout history have come from poor experimental controls: researchers not realizing that there were factors at play that they had failed to control. Either due to sloppy experimental design, or simply because of factors no one knew existed.
