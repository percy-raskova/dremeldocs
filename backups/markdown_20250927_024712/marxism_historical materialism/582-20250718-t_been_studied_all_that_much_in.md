# t been studied all that much in 

@rednewafrikan I agree that this is a crucial area for investigation, and the reason it hasn't been studied all that much in "mainstream communism" is purely down to chauvinism against the lumpen masses. @rednewafrikan Gangs are a huge part of the social fabric for an entire class of millions. It's not as simple as a "social ill preying on the poor," like outsiders think, but it's also not a ready-made revolutionary organization like I've seen some "lumpen orientalists" claim. @rednewafrikan Each gang, faction, city, block, etc. is different and contains numerous contradictions. Some are more progressive than others, some are more predatory, some are more protective of their people.

I would call them a form of mass organization. It's where the masses currently are. @rednewafrikan I think any revolutionary movement here is facile and unserious if it's not engaging with gangs directly. It's certainly much more productive than trying to win over labor aristocrat unions, win elections, and all the other reformist socdem dilly-dallying.
