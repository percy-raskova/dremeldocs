# constant human sacrifice

Let me put this another way:

There's a demon living in my basement who demands constant human sacrifice. He constantly sends me off to bring him his victims. I'm sure this is a good idea, and there's no way he would ever turn on me, right???? https://t.co/eYVSBBhZqq And no, this isn't an "Oh, poor Zionists, tricked into serving a demon!" They're also demons. They're just lesser demons, gleefully partaking in the slaughter. They're simply too distracted by their bloodlust to recognize that the big demon will gobble them up too, someday.
