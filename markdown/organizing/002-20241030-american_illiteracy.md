# American illiteracy

Why is everyone suddenly being such doomers about American illiteracy? Every successful revolutionary movement in history faced even *more* pervasive illiteracy, especially among largely rural populations that weren't just "functionally illiterate," but *completely* illiterate. Literacy programs have ALWAYS been top priorities for communists. Illiteracy isn't an immutable, intrinsic property; it's a present state of things. You know? One of those things we're supposed to be working to abolish? Stop being cowards. Educate.
