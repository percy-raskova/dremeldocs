# @briank_is_here @tweetonwheels @primarycatdad

@briank_is_here @tweetonwheels @primarycatdad This doesn't "codify gay marriage," it codifies that, if a gay marriage is performed in a US state or territory, it must be recognized federally and in all other states and territories. If Obergefell is overturned, any state can still make it illegal to *get* married. @briank_is_here @tweetonwheels @primarycatdad In other words, it is theoretically possible for each individual state and territory to make gay marriage impossible there -- in which case there would be no way to get a gay marriage in the US. There's also no specific recognition of gay marriages performed outside the US. @briank_is_here @tweetonwheels @primarycatdad Even disregarding that scenario, it would still be hell for gay people in the states that *do* repeal gay marriage. Not everyone can just pick up and go to another state to get married -- same as the current situation with abortion and gender affirming care.
