# Now that student loans are starting back up, I literally...

Now that student loans are starting back up, I literally cannot afford housing anywhere close to where I work. Even with the "REPAYE plan," which only cares about gross income, not cost-of-living. And my job doesn't pay nearly enough for the COL of the area. The only way I have my head above water is because I currently rent from someone charging way below the grossly inflated "market rate," and spend 2 hours per day commuting.

It could be worse, obviously. It could be WAY worse. And for a lot of people it is. Basically, what I'm saying is that the economy is in complete shambles. There are no aggregate facts and charts that could ever convince people not to recognize what's right in front of their faces.
