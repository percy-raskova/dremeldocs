# @_SergioFlores @BNODesk Are you aware of the fact that...

@_SergioFlores @BNODesk Are you aware of the fact that everyone who boards intercity rail in China is checked for exposure to COVID? Or that once they reach their destination, their health is continuously monitored? Or that if a case is found in the destination city, they know exactly who was exposed? @_SergioFlores @BNODesk They are locking down an entire city of 4 million people because they found under 100 cases. That's because they know where those cases are, due to this constant vigilance. The fact that 0.0025% of the city is infected is enough for them to take this seriously.
