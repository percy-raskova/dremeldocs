# grandiose, public showings

@bidetmarxman I was more speaking of grandiose, public showings, mostly as a joke.

But in all seriousness, I actually really like "death sentence with reprieve." It's essentially "you're basically already dead... but we'll give you one more chance... but if you fuck up, it's back to dying." @bidetmarxman I mean, we're talking about the people who legitimately reformed a brutal former emperor, who had collaborated with imperial Japan and was all-around the most obvious target of execution ever. China has perfected the art of rehabilitation.
