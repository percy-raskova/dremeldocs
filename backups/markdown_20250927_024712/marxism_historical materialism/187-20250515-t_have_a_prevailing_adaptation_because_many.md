# t have a *prevailing* adaptation because many western 

We don't have a *prevailing* adaptation because many western "Marxists" really don't appreciate the fact that the best theoretical adaptation of Marxism to our contemporary conditions places them in the role of an oppressor class -- the labor aristocracy. https://t.co/mkR4lWS9BO They are desperate to cling to a conception of revolution that is simple and familiar, learned from the history of the Soviet revolution. All they know is proletariat good, bourgeoisie bad, and so any deeper analysis than that feels like an ideological dead end. To the people who are utterly convinced of the necessity of revolution, my message is this: it's okay! It's okay to acknowledge your place in the imperial class structure, to understand that -- as it stands right now -- your classmates do not have revolutionary class interests. The same is true for the "classic petty bourgeoisie." The same is true of the bourgeoisie of oppressed nations. You can be a class traitor. You can assess the class outcomes in front of you and *choose* class suicide over fighting to defend your historically untenable position. Revolution will progress either way. Liberation struggles across the empire, waged by those who don't have that choice, for whom the struggle is life or death. And as they do, the imperial way of life will collapse. Your deferred choice will be made for you one way or another.
