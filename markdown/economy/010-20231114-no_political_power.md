# no political power

1) This is not Gaza, this is Tulkarm, a refugee camp in the West Bank.

2) Hamas has no political power in the West Bank.

3) There is no connection between Yasser Arafat and Hamas. He is seen as a traitor by the resistance for his role in normalizing the Zionist regime. https://t.co/5FsRGe57G6 This is such a poetic explanation of why compromise and normalization is a dead end. Arafat's biggest "accomplishment" was a peace deal in which Palestinians were to lay down their arms, accept colonial rule, and in exchange, "Israel" would stop settling the West Bank. Instead, they spent decades MASSIVELY expanding the settlements. And every Zionist STILL views Arafat as a terrorist for even feebly suggesting that they please stop brutalizing them quite so hard.

The oppressors will NEVER cede ground. Normalization and disarmament NEVER works.
