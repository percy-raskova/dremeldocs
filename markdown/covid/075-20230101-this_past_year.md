# this past year

A personal reflection from this past year is that, for most of it, I have been unusually fatigued, had trouble concentrating, and had a persistent cough and diminished lung capacity, all almost certainly symptoms of long COVID. The past few months SEEM to have been better. My cough has been worse recently, probably due to the weather. But honestly, I think I might be recovering somewhat.

It could be my imagination, or it could be that long COVID is not degenerative, or it could be that it just comes in waves, and I've been lucky. There's still a lot we don't understand about COVID. We don't know how common viral persistence is, or how long it lasts. Same with any autoimmune effects. We don't have good prophylactics, biomarkers, treatments, or cures.

So to be safe, JUST DON'T GET INFECTED.
