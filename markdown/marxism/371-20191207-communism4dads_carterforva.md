# @Communism4Dads @carterforva

@Communism4Dads @carterforva Once he fixes Virginia! Nothing wrong with having home state priorities. @Communism4Dads @carterforva It's so much easier to improve material conditions for working people through state legislature than through congress. Especially in VA or MD, which are full of corporate Dems. The state houses can be knocked over from the left with no real threat of a far-right pushback.
