# the org's official website

@predederva This isn't the CCP. Those quotes are from the founder himself, on the org's official website. Read it for yourself. @predederva Also, yes, I abhor any Muslim, Christian, Jew, Hindu, etc. that holds to a religious belief that promotes bigotry. That condemnation doesn't include the entire religion, any more than condemning Falun Gong means condemning Buddhism. @predederva If there was a large, media-savvy, well-funded, politically-active "Muslim" cult, I would say the same about them. I would also call The People's Temple a cult if it was still around, despite their false veneer of "socialist ideals."
