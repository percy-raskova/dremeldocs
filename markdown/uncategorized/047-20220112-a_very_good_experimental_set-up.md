# a very good experimental set-up

@mattbc I read the study, and it is not a very good experimental set-up. They look at viral aerosols for 20 minutes, showing that infectiousness drops off quickly, but then levels out. They don't continue to look past that, despite previous studies showing infectiousness lasting hours. @mattbc For comparison, if you have water at a rolling boil, then turn off the stove, it stops bubbling almost immediately, but it can still burn you for a long time.
