# @KirilichLV @yellowparenti

@KirilichLV @yellowparenti You misunderstand. I wasn't saying he said that. I'm saying *you* accused *me* of saying alcohols and amphetamines are the same, which I didn't. I used a simple example to illustrate a generalizable concept. @KirilichLV @yellowparenti It's like if I said "you're comparing apples to oranges," and you said "NO!! WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT FRUITS HERE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ORGANIC MOLECULES!!! APPLES AREN'T THE SAME THING AS AMPHETAMINES."
