# Joe Biden being president does not benefit trans people

I am trans. Joe Biden being president does not benefit trans people. The eliminationist anti-trans forces have only ever gained ground under Biden -- either he doesn't care, or his presence in the white house is irrelevant. https://t.co/zXhpyPxiHR This past year, the Biden administration crafted an Ed. Dept. regulation stating that schools could not have blanket bans on trans athletes, but clarified that they would be permitted to define eligibility in a way that excludes them as a matter of course. As assaults on trans existence continue to escalate -- both in the realm of public policy and private discrimination -- Biden has done absolutely nothing to fight back against this. He has failed to champion specific legislation that he promised, such as the Equality Act... ... leaving queer people subject to housing, employment, and educational discrimination. He has failed to ban conversion therapy, has done nothing to ensure the safety of queer youth kicked out of their homes, and crucially, has done nothing to ensure queer health. His biggest offense, however, is as a stalwart imperialist. He has, as with every president in a generation, expanded the fascist border policies that destroy the families and lives of immigrants, disproportionately harming queer immigrants in the process. His unflinching support for the genocide of Palestinians has contributed to the death, dismemberment, and displacement of thousands of queer Gazans in the past month alone, all of whom have spent their entire lives deprived of healthcare and freedom of movement. Do only the lives of Western queer people matter to you? Are these not our cousins? How can you say with a straight face that you care about queer liberation while ignoring the unending torment wreaked upon endless queer people around the world in the name of US imperialism?
