# the lowest voter enthusiasm

A few things to consider:

1) Biden has the lowest voter enthusiasm of any modern presidential candidate.

2) How many people who are "mildly excited or not very excited" to vote for Biden will decide to stay home rather than vote for a credibly-accused rapist? 1%? 2%? 3) How many percentage points does he lose from the perception of corruption re: Hunter's Burisma position? Another 1%?

4) How many stay home because he's failing to give any ground to the left? Polls suggest around 10-15% of Bernie's voters, or 3-4% of the potential Dem base. 5) He loses another few points from his record on trade.

6) Another few points from his record on social security.

7) Another few from his real-time cognitive decline.

These aren't people who are switching to Trump, just people who aren't going to feel like getting out to vote Each little chunk of voters who go from minimally-enthused to non-enthused matters. All Trump has to do--and you can bet he knows to do this--is hammer each of these things from now until November.

This is possibly the weakest candidate the Democrats could have mustered up.
