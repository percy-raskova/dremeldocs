# t give a shit about the moral 

@JordanLovesMarx I really don't give a shit about the moral "injustice" of economic inequality. I care about the rampant devastation it wreaks on every aspect of society, about the constant degradation of our material conditions, and about the constant, crushing psychic damage being done to us. @JordanLovesMarx Actually, I do care about the injustice from a moral standpoint, but that's just a personal thing, not the basis of a political philosophy ðŸ¤·
