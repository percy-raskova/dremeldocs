# t completely true of the broad mass of people who call...

Seeing some communists "dunking" on this, as if it isn't completely true of the broad mass of people who call themselves "the left."

Socdems, chauvinists, tailists, patsocs, the "COVID is over because no one cares anymore" crowd, "decolonialism is unpopular," etc. https://t.co/16gasVvLE4 Communists are not "leftists." We are the real movement to abolish the present state of things. We stand in direct opposition to the type of vulgar economism referenced by OP. We are the movement of ALL oppressed people, not "the worker" specifically. We are the workers, but we are also those who are barred from work, unable to work, whose work is ostracized, whose very existence is criminalized and policed. We are the movement of the disabled, racialized, queer, imprisoned, ghettoized, migrant, lumpen masses.
