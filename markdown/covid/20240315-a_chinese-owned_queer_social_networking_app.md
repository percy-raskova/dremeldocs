# a Chinese-owned queer social networking app

It's so weird that the all-powerful anti-gay autocracy has done absolutely nothing to crack down on Blued, a Chinese-owned queer social networking app with the largest user base on the planet, which has been operating for over a decade and is worth over $600 million https://t.co/5UlFROi6tZ So crazy that the queer-hating commies granted its parent company a license to offer telehealth services, including pharmacy services, which it does in seamless coordination with established medical institutions, and have recognized it for its public health work on AIDS. Bizarrely, former head of government of China, Li Keqiang, even met with Blued's founder to discuss queer discrimination in China. SUCH A WEIRD THING FOR THOSE WILD AND BARBARIC HOMOPHOBIC COMMIES TO DO HUH??? "The US forced a Chinese company to sell off a gay dating app. This is a violently homophobic act on China's part." Do you really think people are stupid enough to fall for this???
