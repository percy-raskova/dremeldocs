#  when he asked if I did my chores, and I said 

My father once threw away my entire collection of Pokemon cards because he "didn't like my tone" when he asked if I did my chores, and I said "Nope."

After sobbing my way through the dishes, I asked if I could have them back, and he said "What do you mean? I threw them away." I have been yelled at, beaten, barred from social events, made to kneel with my nose and elbows touching the wall, starved, and more, all because I couldn't accurately predict whatever words, vocal inflections, or body language cues were expected of me at any given moment. And it was rarely coming from my peers. Most of them completely ignored me, thought I was a badass for standing up to adults, or treated me like some naive puppy they found on the street. My tormenters were almost exclusively the people given irreproachable power over me. Yet I never developed any sort of complex around the idea of "authority." ðŸ¤” Just *unjustified* authority. Authority granted to those who only want to abuse.
