# its hardiness zone

@Wrong_Salem It won't be impossible to grow, its hardiness zone will simply shift north, making it impossible to grow it *profitably*, due to being unable to hyperexploit the global south. Eliminating capitalism could still save coffee*. @Wrong_Salem *Terms and conditions apply. Ecological and social impact of coffee production will not permit anywhere near the scale of modern commodity production. Post-capitalist production will prioritize human need and ecological sustainability over luxuries.
