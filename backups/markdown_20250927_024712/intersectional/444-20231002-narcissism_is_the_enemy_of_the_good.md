# Narcissism is the enemy of the good

The perfect is not the enemy of the good. Narcissism is the enemy of the good. Lack of solidarity is the enemy of the good. Lack of conviction is the enemy of the good. Bourgeois moralizing is the enemy of the good.

And by "the good," of course I mean "the cause of liberation." https://t.co/zjIHEqZlXT No one achieves perfection or expects it in others. We strive for -- and demand from each other -- constant improvement. Even though it feels like an attack to be shown that you are wrong, it's better than continuing to be wrong. If there's a way to become better, become better.
