# s a problem with the insurance that my mother

Why I support @BernieSanders and #Medicare4All:

I am currently standing in line at the pharmacy, slowly going through withdrawal, because there's a problem with the insurance that my mother's company switched to, and my "birthdate is invalid" so I can't get crucial medication. Maybe it's because my nerves are so frayed, but I am done playing nice about this. If you vote against Bernie Sanders and Medicare for All, I will never forgive you.
