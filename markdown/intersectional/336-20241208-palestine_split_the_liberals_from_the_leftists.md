# Palestine split the liberals from the leftists

Palestine split the liberals from the leftists. Let Syria split the leftists from the communists. https://t.co/WzIJI1AXiG This whole argument from the vaguely radical undifferentiated left-lib sphere is very silly. They're always indignant that we "somehow" disagree with them on lines they "happen" to share with the US imperial regime, acting like we should be concerned about isolating ourselves. We don't share "universalist principles of equality and justice," as defined within the liberal philosophical framework. Our ideology is not built on vibes, which are constantly being shaped by hegemonic cultural forces. They believe the things they find easy to believe... ... without ever dissecting why it "makes sense." Their scrutiny over claims of abuse by the enemies of the US is laughable, and the *only* occasion where they have diverged from the imperial line is in the case of the most blatant genocide we have ever seen. Having that object lesson of what genocide and repression actually look like has done nothing to move these valiant warriors of "universal principles" on the notion that China is genocidal, that the DPRK is an open air prison, that Assad is a moustache-twirling supervillain, etc. And it never will. Because to them, the material investment they have in the maintenance of the empire -- which relies on the existence of these "villains" for legitimacy -- means open credulity toward all the lies. Their sense of "justice" extends only as far as empire permits.
