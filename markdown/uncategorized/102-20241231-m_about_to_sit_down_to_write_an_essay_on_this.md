# m about to sit down to write an essay on this tendency of...

@probablykaffe I'm about to sit down to write an essay on this tendency of western communists to pick and choose which "contradictory" revolutionary theses to uphold -- a tendency which neglects the core principle of empiricism: controlling your variables. @probablykaffe Observations made in a vacuum are useless, and attempting to draw conclusions from them is what leads to eclecticism, superstition, and an inability to formulate a coherent, scientifically rooted practice that addresses the real conditions you face.
