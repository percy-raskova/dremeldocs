# s not that they

@catladyactivist It's not that they're more likely to contract and transmit the virus, since the vaccines are largely obsolete at this point. The problem is that, by never getting vaccinated in the first place, they've already demonstrated their pathological disinterest in public health. @catladyactivist Saying "I'm vaccinated" does nothing for me. Saying "I'm unvaccinated" makes me think you are an insane, untrustworthy person. Unless you follow that up with a legitimate medical reason, and are wearing a respirator as we speak.
