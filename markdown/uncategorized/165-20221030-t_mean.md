# t mean 

@m1vql1hdwt I don't mean "informed" as in knowledgeable of history or theory. I'm talking about raw data: Mary just got laid off because she's expecting a baby, Jabir keeps getting asked to work off the clock, an apartment block on North Avenue doesn't have fire suppression, etc. @m1vql1hdwt These are things we necessarily learn from the people they directly affect. It's our job to gather that data, synthesize a theoretical approach, source solutions, and keep tying everything together into a coherent mass struggle. @m1vql1hdwt If I'm the head of a lab, I MUST have a better scientific background than my researchers to guide them. But practically ALL of the data is coming from them. We have lab meetings, presentations, journal clubs, and I would use my scientific understanding to keep everything moving.
