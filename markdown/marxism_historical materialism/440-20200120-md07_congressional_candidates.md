# #MD07 congressional candidates

At a debate for #MD07 congressional candidates

@JillPOnTheHill: When he was in congress, Kweisi Mfume passed a crime bill that contributed to mass incarceration.

Mfume: Yeah, but we had 352 murders in Baltimore the year before that bill! It worked!

Baltimore, 2019: 348 murders Mfume also pointed out that "Jill's presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, also voted for that bill."

I sooooo wanted to stand up and say "Per the debate rules, Bernie Sanders gets 45 seconds for rebuttal. As a Sanders delegate, I will speak on his behalf." "Bernie voted *against* several crime bills before that one. The only reason he voted for the 1994 bill was because he, as the Amendment King, managed to sneak in the Violence Against Women Act into the bill. And even at that time, he called out mass incarceration as horrifying." He has since acknowledged that the bill *did* contribute to mass incarceration, and regrets compromising.

Mfume still seems to think 4 fewer murders per year was worth uprooting the lives of millions of people, undermining black and working class communities.
