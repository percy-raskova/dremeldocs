# all BCPSS staff

I would like to formally offer my services to @BaltCitySchools in designing and coordinating a PCR testing program for all BCPSS staff and students. It could operate M-F, test individual samples, and get accurate results out within 24 hours. I am perfectly happy to come up with the plan and coordinate hiring and acquisitions completely pro bono, although obviously you'd need to put the technicians and sample couriers on the payroll, provide the funding for equipment, reagents, and database, and provide us the space.
