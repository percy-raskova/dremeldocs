# Ooh! 🙋‍♀️ I know the answer to this one

Ooh! 🙋‍♀️ I know the answer to this one! 🙋‍♀️

Stop doing baby-radical stuff like organizing an entire event whose purpose is to stand around and wait for the police descend on you so you can point out how mean they are.

(Talk about "leaving the 2010s behind" lol) https://t.co/sdqEytaod9 You know how you avoid risking your disabled comrades getting brutalized by police? Stop treating this like a fun little game of full-contact cops and robbers. There is no context in which we should be intentionally putting civilians in the line of fire, undefended. That includes bystanders as well as the members of our organizations who happen to not be soldiers. At the moment, that is *everyone*. If you don't have a military wing, you don't have a fully-developed communist party -- and you don't have a right to direct *other* communists. This entire discourse is the pathetic daydreaming of a "movement" that is no closer to revolution than it was a hundred years ago. So many people, frustrated that no one is taking seriously the full weight of what's in front of us, that they construct fantasies of what could be. If you haven't even moved beyond "protest," then improving your physical prowess should be the least of your concerns. We are so beyond this petty liberal individual radicalism having any usefulness.
