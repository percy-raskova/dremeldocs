# A single methyl group

@yellowparenti A single methyl group transforms a substance that will kill you after drinking 15 mL into a happy funtime chemical (that will still kill you, but at much higher quantities over a shorter time frame). We have highly specific enzymes for handling one, but not the other. https://t.co/e06iz90RiI @yellowparenti I get that your point is that moralizing over meth vs amphetamine is silly, but they do have very different outcomes in the context of human biochemistry and physiology.
