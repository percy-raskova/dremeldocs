# how disproportionately neurodivergent and disabled people

@marxistaztlan Especially evil considering how disproportionately neurodivergent and disabled people ARE the exact poor people this person wants forcemarched out of their petty bourgeois sight. @marxistaztlan It's disgusting how "acceptable" conceptions of disability get pinned up as a rhetorical dress-up doll for bourgeois sensibilities, in the process utterly crushing any disabled people whose existence is inconvenient to that pristine bubble.
