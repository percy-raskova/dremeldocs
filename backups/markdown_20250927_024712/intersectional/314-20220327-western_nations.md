# Western nations

It is really, really alarming how little attention is paid to the rapid consolidation of power of far-right ideologies in Western nations. All other political thought is completely irrelevant in the face of this oncoming tide. If "fascists are bad and they're already here" is not a central point of your political philosophy, you're wasting time. All the other important stuff needs to be tacked on top of that very crucial understanding.
