# activist sphere

@EclecticRadical Consciousness raising among the "activist sphere," absolutely. But they are are not the majority constituency of the revolution. Most people just want to keep their heads down and survive. So it's the business of revolution to materially demonstrate itself as a survival tool. @EclecticRadical It's also not an either/or thing. The more revolutionary infrastructure you build, the more appealing it becomes as a viable strategy for the people who are looking for a strategy. As those people come on board, capacity grows, and you materially entice people who have given up.
