# Gender is a social construct

"Gender is a social construct" doesn't mean gender is *anything*. It means that gender is a set of socially reinforced heuristics that are used to enforce particularized norms. The niche identities listed are aesthetics, not relations to the construction of gender. https://t.co/y7yHgR19n4 No one moderates their interactions with you, consciously or unconsciously, based on whether or not you are "cluttercute" or "lacedecorated." You are not barred from employment, ejected from your home, or subjected to violence on the basis of "sealacean" aesthetics. There's nothing wrong with identifying with various aesthetics, like "punk" or "flowery" or "rainfrilled," but if your only form of "oppression" is having people not place that identification on the same level as gendered oppression, you can't be offended at the "erasure."
