# Baseless fear

"Baseless fear" and meanwhile around 16-20% of trans people in the US have been incarcerated at some point in their lives, and FIFTY percent of black trans women. Once there, they face some of the worst conditions of any prison demographic, including sexual assault and death. https://t.co/IoJDWnuJvS What do "concentration camps" look like to you? When fascism knocks on your door, do you imagine it presenting you a business card with its full name and phone number? Do you distrust him any less because he wears a suit and not a totenkopf?
