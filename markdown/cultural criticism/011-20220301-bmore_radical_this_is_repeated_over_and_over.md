# @bmore_radical This is repeated over and over throughout...

@bmore_radical This is repeated over and over throughout history. People with power can't stand to lose even a little bit of that power. So if you leave them with any power at all, they will use what they have to claw back any reforms you've managed to make. @bmore_radical Whether that power is force, property, cultural power, media power, institutional power... They are single-minded, sociopathic, and will do whatever they have to in order to retain, regain, and expand.
