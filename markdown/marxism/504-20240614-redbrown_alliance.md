# Red/brown alliance

"Red/brown alliance" is not a real thing. It is variously used by fascists masquerading as communists (e.g. Aleksandr Dugin), fascists masquerading as liberals (e.g. Alexandre del Valle), and liberals masquerading as "democratic socialists" (e.g. Alexander Hernandez). https://t.co/jMbpMUUnez The purpose of this myth is to conflate "far left" and "far right" ideologies in order to simultaneously legitimize fascism and denigrate communism. In the real world, this unity is simply impossible: there is no version of communism that can contain a single particle of fascism. What all those Alexes skip over in their "analysis" is the characteristic difference between the national consciousness of oppressed nations and the "great-nation consciousness" that defines fascism. National liberation is a key component of communism -- and the enemy of fascism. PFLP's alliance with Palestinian nationalists is not a tactical error, it is a deliberate and immutable part of the struggle for liberation. The oppression faced by Palestinians is through the lens of their national identity, and that cannot be undone without a national movement. It is impossible for those who seek to retain their great-nation status to reckon with this simple truth, because it would require divesting themselves of the material advantages afforded to them by national oppression. Instead, they uphold a mythical "socialism, absent nations." And within that ideological framework, any alliance between Marxists and a fully-conscious movement of oppressed nations must be relegated to the realm of "distraction from class" or "a foolish deal with the devil." Meanwhile, they see no devilry at play when they ally with the oppressor national identity. They call themselves "American socialists" or "French socialists" or "Russian socialists." 

In other words, they are National Socialists.
