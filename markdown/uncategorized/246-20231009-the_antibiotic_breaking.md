# the antibiotic breaking

@antiviral_mktng I wonder how much of this effect can be attributed to the antibiotic breaking down over time. They didn't seem to test that by, e.g. attempting to inoculate the center section with the ancestral strain towards the end of the experiment. @antiviral_mktng I mean obviously heavy selective pressure is going on. I'm just saying it might not be quite a 1000x concentration anymore after all that time at optimal growth temperature. I've had antibiotic plates completely degrade before when left at room temperature.
