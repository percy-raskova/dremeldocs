# @bmore_radical Does he think he'll be voted out of office...

@bmore_radical Does he think he'll be voted out of office for having the courage to vote no? Because it kinda seems like he'd be a citywide hero.

Or does he actually believe in increased police spending, but still takes the political "risk" of verbally denouncing it? @bmore_radical Like, the language means he's not in the good graces of the pro-cop city leadership, but voting pro-cop means he's also betraying his "progressive" base. It's not just spinelessness, it's self-destructive spinelessness.
