# Strategy is contextual

Strategy is contextual. If your practice isn't working with your material conditions, it's not the conditions that are "wrong," it's the practice that is failing to fit the context.

If you can't open a lock with a particular key, don't just blame the lock: try a different key. https://t.co/CAkiLhVLvc Organizing is about figuring out which things you have the power to change and changing them. You take the actions available to you in order to expand that power, then you change more things. It's an iterative process, and you can't give up on step one. The ultimate goal is to change those very same material conditions that prevent revolution. Every movement in history started from a place of operating under material conditions that were resistant to revolution -- which is how that hegemony came to be in the first place. Successful movements have always been the ones which studied their social context and actively worked *within* those conditions, addressing the obstacles and overcoming what was once an impossible prospect. They didn't have magical powers and they didn't get lucky. They adapted.
