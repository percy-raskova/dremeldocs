# Sure, you need to tailor your rhetoric to your audience,...

Sure, you need to tailor your rhetoric to your audience, but you also *choose* your audience. The audience for anything revolutionary should be those who hear "America is fascist" and instead of punching you in the face, go "Wait... what do you mean by that?"

(Or they go "Yup!") https://t.co/gCDXVghQLP The "don't say fascist, that's too divisive!!" crowd are saying that because they are fundamentally uninterested in cultivating that audience. Because they believe that *they* and *their* social cohort are the revolutionary subject that must be begged to participate in revolution They're wrong. Revolution does not need their consent, or the consent of every social fraction -- only the ones whose very existence is constantly at risk by the fascist regime under which we live. Ignore (or pretend to ignore) its nature, and you will never defeat it.
