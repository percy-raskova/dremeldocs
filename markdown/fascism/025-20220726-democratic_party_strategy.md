# Democratic party strategy

Democratic party strategy has 4 simple steps:

1) Spend donation money propping up fascists in GOP primaries.
2) Fundraise off the fact that there are FASCISTS in the general election.
3) Win against some fascists, lose against others.
4) Repeat. They are literally making "be a fascist so Democrats will fund you" into a legitimate political strategy.
