# @JordanLovesMarx I disagree

@JordanLovesMarx I disagree. I think fascism is naturally born out of the mounting contradictions of capitalism, but capitalism is not the *only* path to fascism.

Fascism, at its core, is the manifestation of a mythologized "natural" social hierarchy. @JordanLovesMarx The fascist views modern society as having been perverted by upsetting the "natural" social order. They believe in race hierarchy, sex hierarchy, national hierarchy, etc. Any movement toward equality is therefore "backwards," and is the cause of any social ills.
