@JulieCa50323869 I was going to mention trauma and stress, since cortisol is known to be pro-inflammatory, and chronic stress is linked to dysregulation of the kinds of cytokines we see in immune response. But in my view, the evidence there is weaker for causation. @JulieCa50323869 And of course environmental factors - like viral infection! - clearly play a huge role. "Toxin" is a pretty nebulous term, but certain things like heavy metals are already fairly established causative agents.
