# 40 babies

@m1vql1hdwt Yeah, the "40 babies" thing was literally just something spread around on social media because some random anonymous troll made that claim.

But the broader point still stands that officials have been consistently parroting unsubstantiated claims, citing each other. @m1vql1hdwt But yes, it is ironic that a post about how easy it is to implant false memories contains a false memory of false memory implantation.
