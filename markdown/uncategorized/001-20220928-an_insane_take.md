# an insane take

This is an insane take. Surrogacy is still legal in Cuba, just not *commerical* surrogacy.

Imagine banning the commercial selling of organs and having liberals say "BUT PEOPLE WANT TO SELL THEIR ORGANS!! BODILY AUTONOMY!!!!" https://t.co/SFMYIf23Zh Did you know Twitter still gives you about half a second to screenshot private tweets lol.

I'll still respect privacy though. https://t.co/NSWC0YxGNH
