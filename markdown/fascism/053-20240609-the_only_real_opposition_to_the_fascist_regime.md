# The only real opposition to the fascist regime inside 1948...

"The only real opposition to the fascist regime inside 1948 Palestine" is a wild thing to say about a party that maintains a stance that that fascist regime is a legitimate entity, and just needs to recognize a Palestinian rump state in the West Bank and Gaza. https://t.co/ks78jKKMmK "mostly Palestinian--" they are an Israeli party. They uphold the legitimacy of Israel. They condemn the Palestinian liberation movement. Heritage doesn't mean shit if you support the occupation of a single square inch of the occupation of Palestine.
