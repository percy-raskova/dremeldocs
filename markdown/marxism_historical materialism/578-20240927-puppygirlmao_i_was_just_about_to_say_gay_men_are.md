# @PuppygirlMao I was just about to say: gay men are not, by...

@PuppygirlMao I was just about to say: gay men are not, by default Queer. They *can* be queer, but they could also basically just have the exact same, class-rooted instincts toward the hegemonic culture as straight men do. @PuppygirlMao This isn't some rigorous thesis or anything, I'm just yapping. The general vibes I'm yapping about *are* based in actual material forces though.
