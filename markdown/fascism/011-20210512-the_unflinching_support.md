# the unflinching support

How are Americans Jews not suspicious of the unflinching support of Israel by far-right Christian evangelicals? These are the same people who marched in Charlottesville chanting "They won't replace us!"

Their motives are not pure. A central tenant of their harmful, ethnonationalist belief system is the Christian conception of the end of the world. They believe the literal word of the bible, which claims that a precondition for the end times is the reestablishment of a Jewish kingdom in Israel. Not a nation--an ancient, biblical ethnostate comprised of Jews and Jews alone.

They see the purging of indigenous Palestinian populations from the entire region, including Gaza and the West Bank, as a precondition for their long-sought apocalypse. They don't support Israel for the sake of the Jews. The goal is the establishment of a Jewish kingdom, which will then be destroyed in a holy war.

These people are no friends to the Jewish people. They want us to do the dirty work of ethnic cleansing, and then wipe us out.
