# people give propaganda a bad name 

These people give propaganda a bad name. They are so fucking inept, and it doesn't matter, because racist, genocidal westerners will gobble down whatever propaganda they need to in order to feel good about the genocide. https://t.co/aUPJ21Xhfu Their brilliant propaganda strategy includes "Did you hear that our enemies rape people and behead babies? It totally happened." And every "super duper totally not racist" liberal IMMEDIATELY believed it, because their gut told them "Of course they would do that, they're icky!" Hamas and ISIS *despise* each other. ISIS has attacked Hamas, and decried them as apostates. They have diametrically opposed ambitions, and anyone with a brain knows the difference. But racists have no brain. All they know is "DURRR BROWN PEOPLE ANGRY AND VIOLENT AND BAD" As much as the horrific intention and alarming success of this type of propaganda should bother anyone, I am equally pissed off at JUST HOW BAD THE CONTENT IS! Put some *effort* in, you disgusting fascists! It's not fair how hard those of us with standards have to work to convince people of real things, while those aligned with imperialism and white supremacy can just say "Our opponents breed puppies to feel extra pain so that it hurts more when they boil them alive!"
