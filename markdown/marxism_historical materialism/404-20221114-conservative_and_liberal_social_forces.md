# "conservative" and "liberal" social forces

@Rocko64_ This lines up elegantly with the view of "conservative" and "liberal" social forces as simply being two approaches toward consolidating hegemony: the former wishes to repress cultural diversity, the latter to assimilate it. "Colonization" is where the dominant cultural current @Rocko64_ has no real liberal element toward a particular colonized people--or where liberal attitudes are only recent. Colonized people are seen as inherently un-assimilatable, largely because their culture is so tied to class struggle and return of stolen capital.
