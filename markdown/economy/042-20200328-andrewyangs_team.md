# @AndrewYang's team

Can anyone put me in touch with @AndrewYang's team? I have some political advice I'd like to offer pro bono. Specifically, if he's really regretting endorsing Biden, like he's implied, now is the perfect political moment to reverse that. All he has to do is go on air and say "I originally endorsed Joe because I thought he was the best positioned to take on Donald Trump. I had differences with him, but I was willing to put them aside for the sake of party unity. It was time to support the man I thought would win. "But while I could overlook those policy differences, I cannot overlook misogyny. I can't stay silent, and let my name stay attached to man credibly accused of sexual assault. I have to retract my endorsement of Joe Biden." By doing this, Yang would masterfully cover for his hasty endorsement. He'd have a perfectly acceptable reason for un-endorsing Biden. He'd get out ahead of the story, add fuel to it, and lead the charge of consolidating around the candidate who can actually lead the party.
