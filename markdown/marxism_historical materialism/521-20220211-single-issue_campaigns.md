# single-issue campaigns

@roniscoundrel DSA *could* be a vital part of the struggle, as a way of integrating single-issue campaigns (elections, labor fights, etc.) into the backdrop of a national movement. Funneling national org resources (money, volunteers, training) to these causes to provide a sense of continuity. @roniscoundrel When it's nothing but a bunch of Warren-crats, obviously they'll never do that. They'll always be the "we have a plan for that!" people that don't feel like part of the community.

But education *itself* doesn't remove you from the community. The graph is worthless on its own.
