# delicious homemade sauerkraut

Did you know you're allowed to just chop up a cabbage, sprinkle on some salt, and let it ferment into delicious homemade sauerkraut? Like, it's totally legal, anyone is allowed to do it. Recipe:

- Cabbage
- Add 2% the weight in salt
- Squish it around several times over a few hours, gently squeezing out water to create a brine
- If necessary, add enough extra 2% salt brine to cover it
- Weigh it down to keep everything from being exposed to oxygen
- Wait There's a reason basically every culture on the planet figured out lacto fermentation. It's dead easy.
