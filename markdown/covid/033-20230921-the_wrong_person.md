# the wrong person

@VancouverGordo I think you're arguing with the wrong person. I am not against vaccines: I'm simply saying that they are wholly insufficient. Notice how, in this study, they demonstrate the rapidly waning effectiveness: 0% effective against infection by 16 weeks. @VancouverGordo Also notice how the effectiveness against hospitalization or death drops below 50% almost immediately, and never even hits 70% effectiveness. They keep trending downward, below 40%, past the window of observation of 23 weeks. It has been 52 weeks since I got the booster. @VancouverGordo On a population level, this is pathetic. If those numbers held, an updated booster, available annually, would keep deaths at about 30% lower than what they otherwise would be. Think about how terrifying COVID was, back when you cared: are you fine with "just" 70% of that horror?
