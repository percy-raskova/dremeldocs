# 🔴 Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine:—Gaza...

🔴 Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine:—Gaza defends and fights with its flesh and blood, and the flag will not fall.The enemy's decision to cut off all communications and internet services to the Gaza Strip, (1/9) following its threats of committing more genocidal crimes and escalating brutal bombing, is an attempt by the enemy to silence the voice of Gaza, to hide images of its crimes and defeats, and to use shock to spread fear among the steadfast residents of Gaza. (2/9) What the Popular Front fears and warns against are the ongoing brutal crimes by the enemy's army and air force against defenseless women, elderly, and children, especially given the enemy's escalation of its aerial, naval, and ground bombardment. (3/9) Any enemy ground incursion attempts, no matter their form or size, will only be met with increased resistance, and the enemy will face surprises prepared by our people's resistance that they are unaware of. (4/9) Our people should be confident of the readiness and capability of the resistance.The Front warns against exploiting the communication blackout in Gaza to spread rumors and circulate the enemy's lies, (5/9) urging our people and Palestinian journalists to make their best efforts to convey the truth to the masses using any available means. (6/9) The Front calls on Palestinian companies and entities to urgently find solutions that enable the residents of Gaza to access communications, warning against any negligence in this regard, (7/9) especially since these communications are essential for residents to access emergency and ambulance services.The Front also calls for an escalation of Arab popular and official efforts to stop the aggression, emphasizing the necessity of working on bringing aid, (8/9) volunteers, and international delegations to the Strip to relieve its people and wounded, and to reveal the scale of the zionist crimes committed in the Strip.Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 27th October 2023 Central Media Department.
