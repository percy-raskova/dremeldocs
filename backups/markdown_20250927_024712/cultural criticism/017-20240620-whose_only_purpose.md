# whose only purpose

Stop talking about weirdos whose only purpose is to grab attention. They are literally funded by an oil heiress, and their job is to distill "climate activism" down to performance -- both to divert radicals away from genuine organizing and to garner "mainstream" condemnation. The "discourse" around whether their specific actions are "good" or "bad" is pointless. Wrong conversation entirely.

It should be "What should be doing now that we have decades of proof that throwing paint on things doesn't change a fucking thing?"
