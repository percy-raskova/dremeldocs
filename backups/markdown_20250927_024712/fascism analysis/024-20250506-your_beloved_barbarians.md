# your beloved barbarians

When your beloved barbarians-at-the-gates genre piece explores even a little deeper into the fascist mythos of social strife stemming from incursion of alien elements forcing the breakdown of "natural" hierarchy: https://t.co/Gp0uFPVF1l I get it. It's viscerally fun to watch people struggle to survive and thrive in an apocalyptic scenario, and even more fun when that survival involves blowing heads off of monsters. But there is simply no version of the zombie genre that does not lionize fascist mythemes. Try vampires on for size. Oppressive, clever, willfully sinister lords who drain your life force and exert dominance over humanity, and whose rule must be violently overthrown by ordinary, yet highly organized human beings.
