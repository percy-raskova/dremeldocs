# @JosephARaines That's a good way of putting it

@JosephARaines That's a good way of putting it.

Just like with Marx's formulation of capital circuits being viewable in 3 forms that are all really the same process, we can view imperial extraction and superwages as forming various circuits with overlapping reference points. @JosephARaines So the exploitation of "lesser labor" is part of the reproduction of superwages, and the subsequent accumulation of wealth in the hands of the labor aristocracy is also part of the reproduction of the circumstances for that exploitation.
