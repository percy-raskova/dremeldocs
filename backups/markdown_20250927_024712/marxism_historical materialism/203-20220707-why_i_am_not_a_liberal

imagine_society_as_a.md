Why I am not a liberal:

Imagine society as a classroom in which a child is being disruptive. To the conservative, the solution is simple: whip his hands to make him behave.

But the liberal says "If we whip his hands, he cannot write!" And so, the liberal whips his feet instead. The fascist brings a cop into the classroom. The liberal shakes his head and sighs, "What a shame."

But quietly, he thinks "At least he's not my problem anymore."
