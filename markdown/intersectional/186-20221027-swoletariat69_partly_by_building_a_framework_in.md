# @swoletariat69 Partly by building a framework in which...

@swoletariat69 Partly by building a framework in which people can "submit" themselves in service to revolution. Or, to be less weird about it, uniting people materially. Party-led enterprises of gainful employment. Political education as part of an already consciousness-raising experience. @swoletariat69 "Look buddy, I'm not interested in revolution, I just want to make some money so I can afford to live."

Ok. What are your skills and interests? Put those skill to work at [X enterprise]. We'll pay you more, take less of your time, and throw in free education. @swoletariat69 Some would obviously decline on ideological grounds. A larger group will join, but never move beyond simply being employed by the revolution. A small but significant portion will engage more and more with the broader political project. And a core group will become cadre. @swoletariat69 We'd get different proportions depending on the existing political climate obviously. But just by doing this, we'd be *changing* the political climate. We'd be creating an environment of revolutionary spirit. The more of this deliberate work we do, the more attractive we become.
