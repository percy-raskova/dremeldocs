# every socialist project

There's a reason the first item on the agenda for every socialist project from China to Cuba has been literacy programs. Education -- freed from the tether of capital -- is the most powerful tool of liberation. https://t.co/jKGhJW69f5 It is only chauvinism that can place oppressed peoples' historical struggle for education up against the bad vibes of being "forced" to learn, and choose to subordinate liberation to "autonomy." There is no greater source of autonomy than a firm foundation of education. Do not conflate efforts by bourgeois society to inculcate liberal ideology into students with a liberatory pedagogy. If you can't even conceive of social infrastructure that doesn't serve capital, you're conceding the fight to capitalists from the jump.
