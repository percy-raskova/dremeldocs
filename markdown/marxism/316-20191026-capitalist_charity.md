# capitalist charity

@DavidKlion Capitalism is upheld by masses of people who just want Daddy to take care of them (capitalist charity) rather than doing the hard work of standing up for each other (from each according to their ability). @DavidKlion By the way, this is not a reference to people begging for the charity they need to survive. I'm talking about people wanting to be relieved of their social obligation to their class siblings by hoping Daddy will write a check. The capitalist is not our benefactor; he's our enemy.
