# genius asshole

@NiaFrome This is an alarmingly common archetype: the "genius asshole," who is portrayed as being an asshole *because* of his (sometimes her, but usually a man) genius. It's very appealing to people who are already assholes, because it lets them feel like assholery is a sign of genius. @NiaFrome The Greg Houses, Sherlock Holmeses, the Rick Sanchezes, the Sheldon Coopers, even Bojack Horseman (who is not a "genius," but is portrayed as "deep and complicated"). They give people an excuse to feel like the fact that they are unpleasant is actually an *enviable* trait. @NiaFrome Even when these characters are punished in-story for their behavior (and often, they never are), the way it is framed puts their pain at receiving comeuppance as the focus -- yet another "enviable" form of "good damage" designed to elicit empathy from the target audience.
