# answer is * be prepared * for armed struggle , but do n't...

@comrade_eagle The answer is *be prepared* for armed struggle, but don't start it. The observable criteria are:

1) Will armed struggle save more working class lives than it will cost?
2) Will this bring more people onto our side than radicalize them against us? @comrade_eagle Sorry I can't be more specific than that, like "When the Washington monument gets destroyed, it's time for armed struggle." We are in the pre-pre-revolutionary phase, and there's simply no way to predict what could happen in specific terms.
