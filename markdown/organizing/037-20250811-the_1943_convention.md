# the 1943 convention

Good news from the 1943 convention! Our organization just voted to adopt an anti-Nazi position, and it passed with 56% in favor!

Don't worry, the other 43% don't *actually* support the Nazis; they were just worried that if this passed, we'd start purging Nazis. Which we won't! And anyway, if you don't like how many of our people are opposed to kicking out Nazis, you should join us! Otherwise you're a hypocrite, and honestly worse than the Nazis. Also, if we were to just start rejecting anti-anti-Nazis willy-nilly, we'd lose most of our leadership! Didja ever think about that, you ultras???
