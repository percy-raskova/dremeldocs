# allergen priming

@Rocko64_ Honestly, we still know very little about allergies, although a theory that is gaining ground is allergen priming. The idea is that exposure to specific allergens in specific contexts causes your body to mount a persistent immune profile to trigger reaction to future exposure. @Rocko64_ IgE is implicated in mediating allergenicity, and is believed to be our bodies' method of dealing with toxins and/or parasites, rather than viral infections. Nevertheless, viral infections may play a role in "confusing" the immune system, categorizing safe compounds as toxins. @Rocko64_ The hypothesis is essentially that, *while* your body is already actively mounting an immune response to an infection it may be primed it to be on high alert for foreign compounds, and exposure to specific substances leads to generating antibodies to target them. @Rocko64_ Now that your immune system "knows" what threat to look out for, it will continuously restart that immune response every time it encounters it again.

This sounds strictly harmful, but it can lend insight to a powerful evolutionary tool for dealing with a variety of pathogens. @Rocko64_ This mechanism would essentially allow your body to have just one pathway dedicated to adapting to ANYTHING that could cause you harm, rather than requiring a comprehensive library of "canonical" pathogens. @Rocko64_ The simplified pathway would be:

Is there something going wrong? ➡️Yes➡️ Is there a foreign toxin? ➡️Yes➡️ Find it ➡️ Trigger immune response ➡️ Keep a record of that toxin for future rapid response. @Rocko64_ In that context, it actually makes more sense that IgE is exclusively a mammalian thing, evolving during our history of rapidly generalizing to a variety of environments. We would have needed a way to ensure that all these new environments wouldn't expose us to novel toxins.
