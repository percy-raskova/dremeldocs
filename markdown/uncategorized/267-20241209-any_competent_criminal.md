# any competent criminal

They did make an effort, they're just hilariously, completely fallible to any competent criminal. The police state is engineered to pick off stragglers, harass civilians, and control *populations*. It is not an unbeatable panopticon, it's a couple of dudes with binoculars. https://t.co/MTMlQmhn7r They do a great job of *seeming* omnipresent, mostly by throwing waves of grunts at targeted "high crime" districts. They love to strut out their fancy technology and use an unending stream of propaganda showcasing the "skill" of their detectives. But in reality, most escape. The vast majority of crime, from the pettiest thefts to the most gruesome of violent acts, completely evades them. If they even pick up the case at all, it still has better than even odds of going unsolved.

Because that's not the purpose of police. And they're really bad at it.
