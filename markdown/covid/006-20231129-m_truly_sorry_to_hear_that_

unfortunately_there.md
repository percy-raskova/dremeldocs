# m truly sorry to hear that ðŸ˜”

Unfortunately, there

@RodericDay I'm truly sorry to hear that ðŸ˜”

Unfortunately, there's no real way to make a determination for an exact timeline. We still barely even understand the biochemical pathways involved in the development of long COVID, let alone the precise relationship with exertion. @RodericDay My recommendation is to take at least a few weeks off. When you do start to return to exercising, if you notice yourself tiring more easily, ease off. You can't "power through" it -- that can cause further deterioration.
