# Happy pride month

Happy pride month!

There is no regulation in China that prohibits queerness in media, and whenever you hear about a movie "censoring" itself so it can play in China, they are using Sinophobia to both justify their bigotry and normalizing false notions of Chinese "censorship." The closest to this mythical "censorship" is regulations banning all sorts of things, such as racism, sexism, and "obscenity." Nowhere in Chinese law is "obscenity" defined to include queerness, nor have I found any instances of it being used to censor any queer media. I'm happy to be shown counter-examples, of course. But if you come back with an article from a western rag that lays out vague references to some "obscenity law" without citing an actual source demonstrating it in action, I'm just ignoring you. (Pro-tip: if you search "Chinese queer censorship" or "Chinese obscenity law" or similar terms, that's all you're going to get. Try harder, please.)
