# @FoxyMarxist I don't *actually* think most of these posts...

@FoxyMarxist I don't *actually* think most of these posts are feds. I'd say it's usually organic engagement bait and occasionally machine learning bait. To the extent any of it is literally intelligence gathering, it's just an example of the feds hijacking the former, using the latter. @FoxyMarxist No one is targeting *you* in particular to try and pin down your identity through engagement bait trends (yet). It's just a bad habit to get into, answering random internet prompts like this. If you *are* targeted somewhere down the line, your social media history is a goldmine.
