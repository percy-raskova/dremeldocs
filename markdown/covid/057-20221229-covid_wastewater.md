# COVID wastewater

Map of COVID wastewater in the US, courtesy of the CDC. Red dots represent places that are at or near the *highest levels* on record, orange are places with 60%-79% of the highest level, pale blue is 40%-59%. Grey dots are places with no recent data. https://t.co/NnNrxXqotX Keep in mind that many of these sites haven't been in operation for long enough to get a total view of the pandemic. When you exclude sites that started reporting after 12/1/21, the picture looks more like this. Still a lot of highest-ever levels, even including omicron. https://t.co/toz9ZteUmN People may not be testing as much, they might be testing improperly (testing sites still say to swab your nose, ignoring the throat!), and testing sites might not report their data.

It doesn't matter: the poop will always snitch. And the poop says we're headed for a shitstorm.
