# the biggest threat

None of these is the biggest threat to the communist movement. THE threat is imperial chauvinism: a seemingly unshakeable allegiance to a globe-spanning imperialist system that imbues the settler working class with an instinctive material interest in preserving that order. https://t.co/AMCuMZEVkX This is the core contradiction that must be resolved if we want to drive out all the other movement-abjuring tendencies, such as opportunism and reformism. The tension between working class liberation and the abolition of a global system that funnels resources toward the core. It's not a particularly difficult contradiction to resolve, in terms of pure theory. Even setting aside questions of "morality," and "justice," we all instinctively grasp that the entire working class is oppressed under capitalism, and that some are oppressed more heavily. But bridging the conceptual gap between "working class liberation" and "complete liquidation of the US empire" is tough. Getting people to understand that the fundamental nature of revolution means the eradication of the US in its entirety is the largest hurdle we face. Even those who earnestly believe that they are striving for the latter often fail to truly internalize what that means. Most "western Marxists" still have their thoughts suffused with an intractable liberalism, stemming from that empire-fed material instinct. This isn't a denunciation of those who still have some liberalism to shed -- although it IS a denunciation of those who propagate a vision of "liberation" that leaves imperial and colonial systems largely intact. Some know exactly what they're doing, and they do it deliberately. This includes, to varying degrees, every major "socialist" or "communist" organization in North America. Which is exactly why they continue to be legally permitted by the very states they *should* be striving to eradicate. No state tolerates the engine of its own destruction. As long as "Don't get the feds angry with us" is the guiding principle of your organization, it is necessarily not a revolutionary organization.

You should avoid getting shut down *tactically*, not *ideologically*. You are not here to change the system; you are here to break it.
