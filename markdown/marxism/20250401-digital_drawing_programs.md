# digital drawing programs

"Art" made using digital drawing programs isn't real art. It's slop. Uninspired garbage. Anyone can do it, without years of training and practice. You aren't mixing your own pigments, you just pick and choose infinite PREMADE hues. If you mess up a brushstroke, you just undo it. You have all these artificial "layers" to work on, instead of needing to actually PLAN your drawing and COMMIT, like a real artist. These programs incentivize people to just pump out shitty drawing after shitty drawing, and now the art world is FULL of this nonsense. You can easily tell the difference between art made by real human hands and this plastic, disposable, digital drek made with tablets and screens. Perfectly crisp lines, unnatural colors, shapes and curves with uncanny symmetry, etc. I don't understand how anyone enjoys it. It's not rewarding to make art like this! You don't have to struggle like real artists do, working within the confines of a PHYSICAL medium. And at the end of it, all you have is this computer file that can be reproduced instantly and infinitely, cheapening the value of art. Don't even get me started on the MASSIVE amount of energy used by computers when millions of people start using them for drawing, plus all the materials used to make the tablets and graphics cards. Already, giant server farms all over the world are stuffed with digital "art." People are using digital art to plagiarize real art. They're taking existing images, plopping them into these programs, and tweaking them electronically, juuust enough to be able to claim it's theirs. In more egregious cases they don't even do anything except slap on a watermark. And giant corporations of course are the ones to benefit from this. They pump out endless streams of digital animations, garbage-looking cartoons that replace the classic, elegant, hand-drawn animations we know and love. They rip off and edge out the real artists to make a buck. Real artists are dying out thanks to this, replaced with hacks with no talent. It's becoming impossible to make it as a painter, and people are losing their sole source of income. Digital programs turn art into nothing more than a cheap commodity, just to satisfy your laziness. If you participate in this disgusting trend of embracing digital "art," you are a monster. Don't you care about the humanity of art?? Mixing paints, stretching out canvasses, smearing charcoal, watercolor, oil, hell, even pencil sketches! Michaelangelo didn't toil away painting the Sistine Chapel, just for people to take that work and copy and paste images of pig heads and dicks onto it in Adobe Illustrator. You people make me sick.

Stop. Making. Digital. Art.
