# t really have to explain this to 

Feels like I shouldn't really have to explain this to "communists," but here we are.

Queer liberation is not about the freedom to partake in "western decadence." It's about a social cohort that, collectively, is subject to demonstrable, *material* oppression. It's about astonishingly higher rates of homelessness, sexual assault, murder, police brutality, medical malpractice, familial abuse, unemployment, malnutrition, mental illness, suicide, and many, many more abuses. Just like every oppressed cohort, when you control for class (because of course, there are members of any given social cohort with higher class standing), queer people experience significantly worse life outcomes than their peers, due to forces that uphold the gender hierarchy. Different populations are subject to different social forces that oppress them in different ways and to different ends -- but all lead back to the same material base. Queerness is not oppressed on the basis of, for example, land, in the way indigenous people are. Rather, the oppression of queer people is an outgrowth of the bourgeois family form, which relies on the construction and maintenance of a patriarchal gender hierarchy for the purpose of directing social reproduction. This conception of family, gender, queerness, patriarchy, inheritance, and so on, was not pulled out of thin air by the bourgeoisie, and was instead adapted from existing norms for its own purposes as part of an overall hegemonic order as they dominated more and more of society. Similarly, western conceptions of gender and queerness were not simply forced upon other societies that came under imperial control, but rather had those conceptions teased out and heightened from whatever extant gender norms already existed. The consequence of which is that queerness (as a relation of bourgeois, western gender conceptions) is all but universal as a social relation across the world's societies. Queer liberation is as fundamental to revolution as women's liberation, as national liberation, etc.
