# Undocumented immigrants

Undocumented immigrants form a massive cohort of the precariat. Their precarity is among the most brutally enforced, by both legal and extralegal means. The expropriators avail themselves of millions of desperate workers, permanently barred from attaining even proletarian status. https://t.co/kE5easRSoQ Where other sectors of the precariat may dream of one day becoming proletarian (or even bourgeois), if they could only get their feet underneath them, those populations subject to outright criminalization can have no such illusions. This is why "border security" is hegemonic. As fascism continues to coalesce, this form of legally codified and violently enforced permanent precarity is expanded to an ever-increasing population. This is the answer to "Why do they hate [X] so much?" They aim to push as many into exploitable precarity as possible. Don't lose sight of this moving forward. When you see Democrats invoking the need for "border security," don't be shocked that they have the same attitude as Republicans. They are both furthering the fascist aims of the US empire, no matter who sounds "meaner" as they do so.
