# The American people

@wsbgnl The American people are in desperate need of an education in basic economics and history. Wage growth doesn't cause inflation. Wages and living conditions rose dramatically during the period of our greatest economic growth. Both were the result of ascendant organized labor. @wsbgnl The gains weren't equally distributed, obviously. The lion's share went to the business owners, but workers got more than they do now. And we can't ignore the rampant institutional discrimination that kept black, indigenous, and immigrant communities from making as much progress.
