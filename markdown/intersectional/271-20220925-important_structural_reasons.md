# important structural reasons

@blkbateleur There are important structural reasons for this gap.

For one thing, they are *much* more tolerated by state structures, such as police (whose officers are often MEMBERS of these groups), and intelligence agencies, who work their hardest to stamp us out, while giving them a pass. @blkbateleur Also, these groups are largely made of people who already have money and are part of the owning class. Certain other sectors of the capitalist class also support them, paying millions in ad dollars to prop up the network of internet spaces that form a rabbit hole to fascism. @blkbateleur The "conservative" traditional media sphere naturally morphed into a strictly fascist one, through deliberate culture-crafting, profit-seeking sensationalism, and the fact that it is much easier to spread misinformation than to "disprove" it. @blkbateleur White supremacist groups are not rowing against the tide of the hegemonic culture: they are taking it to its inevitable conclusion. It will always be harder for us, because by definition, we are trying to upend the entire fucked-up social order.
