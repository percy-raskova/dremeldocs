# this perspective

@senorhettler I truly understand this perspective, but I also hate when any piece of media tries to "address" COVID, because they always end up minimizing it. Like "Haha, wasn't it so weird and quirky how we had to wear cloth masks and stand 6 feet apart and use hand sanitizer?" @senorhettler I've never seen anything that even *mentions* COVID in the present tense though, and even just that would go a long way.
