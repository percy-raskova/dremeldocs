# @realMICATL @khenny2x

@realMICATL @khenny2x In my view, social programs like food assistance, public health care, and a hypothetical social housing program, should not be in the business of dictating what level of comfort poor people "deserve." @realMICATL @khenny2x Obviously I can't list the exact things you need to live in basic comfort in a tweet. Everyone needs a fridge, it should work reliably, be energy efficient, have decent storage, etc. It doesn't need to be connected to WiFi so you can track "refrigerator rewards" or whatever.
