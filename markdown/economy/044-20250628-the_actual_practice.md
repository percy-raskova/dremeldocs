# the actual practice

It is important to develop and distribute the actual practice of revolution, sharing our methods and results to advance a cohesive movement.

It's just that the twitterfolk "asking" these questions are not interested in that. They are not our peers, and cannot be trusted. https://t.co/p0lpna12g7 They aren't asking "what are you doing?" so they can gain insight for their own practice and provide feedback on yours. They're trying to justify their unscientific practice with "Well at least I'm doing *something*!" even when that something is nothing. If you give them an actual answer of what we should be doing instead, they dismiss it as idealism. Their political philosophy is totally barren, and they can't see anything but the desert. To them, digging aimlessly in the sand is "real," and irrigation is "a fantasy." And of course, if you're any more specific about our aims and methods, how one thing leads to the next, you *still* won't convince them -- but you will open yourself up to state repression before building the capacity to resist it. Basically, never take the bait. Don't let yourself be goaded by those who try to put their pride against yours. You don't need to prove yourself to people who don't accept the proof in front of their eyes. A revolutionary doesn't need brag about what she does -- she just *does*.
