# domestic emissions

First of all, the US and Europe (including the UK) have contributed three times as much as China in domestic emissions alone, even with significantly fewer people. https://t.co/An0RMlvEIy https://t.co/XrjjCpt7K9 Second of all, the global south (including China) net exports energy to the global north at a 3:1 exchange rate. That is, the global south produces goods on behalf of the global north and spends 3x as much energy as they receive in exchange.

https://t.co/D4ELMDTyD5 https://t.co/dOgUO9pB5S To put it simply, a rich country could spend 1 Joule of energy to produce something and trade it for something that took a poor country 3 Joules of energy to produce. The north quite simply does not need to spend energy to continue to extract value from the south. The South is the North's factory. The blame for those emissions belongs to those who profit from them: the US, Europe, and the rest of the countries with a "declining" emissions profile. Just because they shifted production to cheaper territory doesn't change their culpability.
