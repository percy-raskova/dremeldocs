# @LotInLifeProd @vipintukur

@LotInLifeProd @vipintukur Simplified explanation:

The instructions for making important anti-viral machines normally say "MAKE[SXFSD]THE[DWISCLSTOP]MACHINE". The cells cut out the parts in brackets, read "MAKETHEMACHINE," and express the necessary components. @LotInLifeProd @vipintukur SARS-CoV-2 breaks this process by stopping the part of the process that cuts out the extra stuff in the middle. The cells read "MAKE[SXFSD]THE[DWISCLSTOP--" and then stop. So they can't make the machinery properly. @LotInLifeProd @vipintukur Of particular note is MHC-I, which is the machine that presents pieces of the virus on the surface of the cell. The immune system normally sees those pieces and "knows" there's virus inside that must be dealt with. SARS-CoV-2 thereby is able to evade this.
