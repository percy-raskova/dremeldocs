# the inevitable overhyping

This is good, but I feel like I need to get out ahead of the inevitable overhyping; this is NOT a vaccine, it's an antiviral treatment. It's demonstrated to last for 96 hours in the lungs and effectively neutralize *active* infection, but it's not a prophylactic. https://t.co/HFzVZ2aAb8 Given that it retains its effectiveness when stored as a lyophilized powder, I see the most significant eventual use for this on an individual basis as keeping a stock on hand, and then reconstituting it in case of infection. It has yet to be demonstrated what impacts this treatment would have on either the progression of long covid or onward transmission. Although it's reasonable to expect benefits in both, considering the known correlation between them and acute infection severity. So again, this isn't going to be something you can take as a precaution, making it so your eyeball-licking carnival cruise orgy magically becomes "COVID safe." Same with those little "tips and tricks," like UV torches, CPC mouthwash, etc.

We don't yet have a sterilizing vaccine.
