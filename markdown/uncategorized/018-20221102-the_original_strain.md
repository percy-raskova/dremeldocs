# the original strain

Booster doses (of the original strain, not the bivalent booster) LOWER your protection against omicron-descended variants compared to just two doses.

This is in line with some in vitro studies on immune imprinting. https://t.co/48gbv0VKoA Essentially, when you got the first two doses (or when you got infected with a pre-omicron strain), it primed your immune system to be on the lookout for SARS-CoV-2 (good!) When you later have another immunological event (pre-omicron booster, pre-omicron infection), it trains your immune system to be very specific about what to look for in a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Which is bad, because now it's looking for the wrong thing. It's primed to look for something that barely resembles these myriad omicron sublineages. This study didn't look at the bivalent booster, which is targeted to BA.4 and BA.5. I would expect that recovers your protection vs. those particular variants. It also doesn't look at XBB, BQ.1, and BA2.75.2, obviously, since those aren't the predominant waves yet during the time of this study. I would likewise expect underperformance for those whose only immune profile is pre-omicron, and possibly also those who have omicron immunity.
