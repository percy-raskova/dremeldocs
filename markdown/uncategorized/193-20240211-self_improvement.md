# self improvement

Speaking of self improvement, I'm having a lovely time transitioning. My hair looks amazing when I actually take care of it, I'm getting some gentle curves, the thrift stores are overflowing with options for my new style, and I've gotten used to a new name that feels very "me" ðŸ¥° Also, voice training is quite simply impossible. Do not argue with me about this, I don't want to hear it LALALALALALA ðŸ™‰ðŸ™‰ðŸ™‰
