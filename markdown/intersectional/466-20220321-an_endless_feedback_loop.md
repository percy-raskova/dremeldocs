# an endless feedback loop

@BlackRedGuard1 It's an endless feedback loop of the marginalization of communist thought. Communists are not in the public eye, so many communists see "being in the public eye" as diluting communist identity, so they self-segregate, so they are perceived as insular, so they get pushed out more. @BlackRedGuard1 What's the solution? Maybe communists should stop being crazy, egotistical, overburdened with "purity," and acting like this is a social club. Be a PART of the working class. Join unions. Join community associations. Join churches if that's your thing. Be normal, but principled. @BlackRedGuard1 We can talk about messaging and mass media strategies and organizations and whatever. But all of that requires us to have a MUCH more robust and expanded core group. We start by radicalizing our normie friends, which means we start by HAVING normie friends.
