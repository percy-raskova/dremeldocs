# level of poverty

I wonder what "level of poverty" I was in when I left my ultra-religious parents to go live on a mattress on the floor, and was calculating how many calories per dollar I could get from a diet of rice and beans. https://t.co/GjwWy3rfQl I would call that the *upper* level of poverty, because at any time, I instinctively knew I could (probably) just move back into my parents' basement (and the closet).
