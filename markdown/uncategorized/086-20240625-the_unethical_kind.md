# the unethical kind

@LMillzEsq Specifying that your apple eating is ethical puts the onus on the very concept of apple eating to "prove" that it is not "the unethical kind." Like you mention "I see nonmonogamy as more of a 50-50 split." I see apple-eating as a 50-50 chance whether or not you stole that apple. @LMillzEsq The very fact that you somehow have this perception of a 50-50 split is *exactly* what I'm talking about. In MY social sphere, I know exactly 2 people who have ever cheated on a partner, long ago, very few who have been cheated on, about about 100 who have/had multiple partners.
