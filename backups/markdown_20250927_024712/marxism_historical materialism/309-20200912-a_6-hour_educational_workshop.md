# a 6-hour "educational" workshop

I have to attend a 6-hour "educational" workshop to get a homebuyer grant, and I can honestly say I have seen the enemy and it is the financial sector. The "education" is literally this:

"62% of Americans have less than $1,000 in their bank accounts. That tells me people are bad at budgeting!" "I'm going to teach you how anyone can save that $12,000 with even just a $200 surplus."

*Proceeds to explain that maybe those weekly manicures are a want and not a need.* Here's another trick: make sure you pay off your credit card bills every month! Just take all that money you definitely have and use it to pay your balance in full!
