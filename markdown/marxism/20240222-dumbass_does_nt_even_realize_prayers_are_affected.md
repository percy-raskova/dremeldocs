# dumbass does n't even realize prayers are affected by...

This dumbass doesn't even realize prayers are affected by gravity and pulled along the curve of the Earth 🤣🤣🤣 https://t.co/SLMrmQzqnR All religion is pretty silly, but there's a reason you don't see me dedicating my life to "disproving" unfalsifiable beliefs in such a snarky way. All that really matters is the political character of what people believe and the practical outcomes of those tendencies. Religion is a potent breeding ground for reactionary tendencies, and I certainly wouldn't suggest Marxist ignore that fact. But "Haha, look at these fools!"-style "atheism" is very clearly its own reactionary subculture. They apply one form of material analysis and then give up. Because they aren't actually interested in finding truth, they just want to feel smug. And more often than not, they are intimately invested in a social order that materially advantages them, to which they apply no critical analysis whatsoever. It's pathetic. More than pathetic: it's a crucial element of a particular subspecies of fascism. That's what you're instinctively chafing at when you deride "Reddit atheism."

But let's be clear: "atheism" is not fascist. Marxism is inextricably secular, whatever your personal beliefs are.
