# vertebrate species

@BlackVelvvett Cats and dogs have driven dozens of vertebrate species to extinction and critically endanger hundreds more. So pets *themselves* do wreak havoc on native ecosystems when they aren't constrained. However, the data on trap-neuter-release shows that it's insufficient to stop this. @BlackVelvvett The populations of feral cats and dogs are so huge that TNR doesn't have an impact on population growth and ecological damage: you simply cannot catch enough to overcome the invasive population dynamics. However, keeping them off the streets entirely is still better, and... @BlackVelvvett ... the primary purpose of neutering pets is to minimize the chance of unwanted puppies and kittens finding their way back onto the streets, due to irresponsible owners.

However, I can't find data to speak to the actual effectiveness of this widespread practice.
