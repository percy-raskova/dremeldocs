Why would I trust chicken served by a restaurant that readily admits to serving plates of shit? The whole kitchen is contaminated with fecal matter, there's no reason not to suspect the chicken also has shards of glass in it, and any health authority would shut down the business. https://t.co/O3AdIQOP9J Also, the chicken supports genocide to the tune of billions of dollars per year, condemned us all to flounder in a still-ongoing pandemic, suppressed a railway strike, and is edging us ever closer to hot war with two nuclear-armed powers.
