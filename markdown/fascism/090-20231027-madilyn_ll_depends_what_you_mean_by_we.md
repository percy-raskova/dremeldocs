# @Madilyn_ll Depends what you mean by "we."

@Madilyn_ll Depends what you mean by "we." *Communism* has a plan. "We," as in the people I align with politically, have a vision and a broad outline of how to get there -- we just need to do the work of particularizing that plan and concretely building it. @Madilyn_ll We certainly have more of a plan than:

1. Vote for Democrats, who support genocide and imperialism and poverty and unlimited disease and the acceleration of biosphere collapse.

2. ????

3. We're safe from (Christo??) Fascism!
