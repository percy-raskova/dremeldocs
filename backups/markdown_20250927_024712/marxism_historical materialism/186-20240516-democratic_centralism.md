# democratic centralism

Starting to get the sinking feeling that none of you actually know what "democratic centralism" means. Factions and debate are not only "allowed," but actively nurtured, as a means of internal struggle, which is necessary to reach unity of action. https://t.co/e29vnxuy8c What's not tolerated is *liberal* factions. Why would Marxists have any interest in "debate" over liberal notions, or "compromise" with liberal prescriptions of action? Liberalism has no home in a Marxist party any more than Marxism has a home in a liberal one. We don't have a moral duty to assimilate "all perspectives" to achieve some metaphysical democratic purity. Some perspectives are reactionary, counter-revolutionary, harmful to the movement, passive, reformist, etc. If you want petty democracy, go practice liberalism elsewhere.
