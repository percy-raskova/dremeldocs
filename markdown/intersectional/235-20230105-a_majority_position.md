# a majority position

@justinqtaylor First, for most of the pandemic, support for masks has been a majority position: that number has steadily declined the farther removed we get from mask mandates, because enough people have been convinced the pandemic is over.

But I'm not even talking about the short term. @justinqtaylor My point in bringing up life expectancy is that, no matter what public perception currently is, the pandemic is still here, and it's still actively harming the health of the entire population. The longer it goes on, the more life and health expectancy will decline. @justinqtaylor More and more people will be forced to exit the workforce (wholly or even just partially) due to death, disability, or simply getting "too old to work" at younger ages. The limits of constant economic growth will be reached even faster, leaving working class people in poverty. @justinqtaylor I'm not even claiming that will magically lead to some sort of transition to socialism: just an increasingly desperate population. It has a high potential to lead to fascism, especially in the context of ever-increasing climate destruction, triggering mass migration.
