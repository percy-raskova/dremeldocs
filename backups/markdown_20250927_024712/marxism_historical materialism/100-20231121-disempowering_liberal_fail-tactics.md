# disempowering, liberal fail-tactics

@w0kesolanas @CommieChip Yeah, the picture that seems to be emerging seems to be a politically naive, but ultimately principled, young potential-revolutionary being suckered in by disempowering, liberal fail-tactics, as encouraged by a definitively liberal organization, headed by a bourgeois liberal. @w0kesolanas @CommieChip Whether Fergie Chambers is *deliberately* doing this to drag down the movement, or is simply blinded by liberal ideology, unaware of the damage done by this strategy is irrelevant. The end result is the same.
