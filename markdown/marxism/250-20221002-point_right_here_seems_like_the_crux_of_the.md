# point right here seems like the crux of the disagreement 

This point right here seems like the crux of the disagreement.

The "vote for Democrats" people seem to be implicitly adding "... because we can't vote in communism yet."

We will NEVER be able to vote in communism. Understanding that is not being "ultra-left." https://t.co/O1orG16KHd If you believe your vote in a particular race stands between a particular fascist and elected office, it's obviously better to vote against them. But that is literally the extent of what we can do with bourgeois democracy.

All power to the soviets!
