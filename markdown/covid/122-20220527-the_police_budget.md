# the police budget

@jedweeks We should just use the police budget to hire teachers. Require all the normal educator qualifications, exact same teacher duties, they don't get a badge or gun or literally any police stuff except police budget money. If any DOJ people ask, just call them "education officers." @jedweeks I should clarify I am not actually being serious about tainting public education with the stench of police.
