# a pretty elementary example

This is actually a pretty elementary example of the concept that nothing exists in isolation: the character of a thing is defined by its relations to its surroundings. The KMT didn't "flip on a dime," they were revolutionary in one context and reactionary in another. https://t.co/8enHPS7ydI Specifically, their interests aligned with the communists in the fight against empire, and diverged in the fight for socialism.

"Change into its opposite" is a rhetorical device, not a literal description of a magic wand being waved and instantaneously turning sugar into salt.
