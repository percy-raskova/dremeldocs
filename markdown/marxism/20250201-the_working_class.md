# the working class

Why hide behind the working class in your defense of *your own* proclivities?

You don't have the courage to come out and say "*I* am religious, so it offends *me* to suggest communism is atheistic." Instead you act like this is the one tendency The Masses™️ would never abandon. Presumably, you don't use this line of reasoning for other tendencies -- the various forms of chauvinism, individualism, and idealism that are found all throughout the working classes. Unless you yourself are transphobic, you don't claim trans liberation is anti-working class. "This is what [my perception of] the working class believes" is not a reason for us to adopt any given attitude. You must know this. The working class by and large believes revolution is impossible. They believe communism is "just as bad or worse." They believe incorrect things. Tailism is the graveyard of revolution, and most of you understand that. So why do you reach for that when it comes to *your* beliefs? Do you not have anything else to defend yourself with?

Just say "I am religious. Please leave me alone, I do not want this belief challenged." I would certainly respect that attitude more than this cowardly appeal to an abstract vision of "the intractable masses." Being religious in and of itself is not the same thing as being a chauvinist. It's not something we need to brutally expunge from our movement.

Tailism is.
