# Twitter Discourse

I must not engage with Twitter Discourse. Twitter Discourse is the mind-killer. Twitter Discourse is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face Twitter Discourse. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the Twitter Discourse has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
