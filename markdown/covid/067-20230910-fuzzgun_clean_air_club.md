# @_Fuzzgun @Clean_Air_Club

@_Fuzzgun @Clean_Air_Club_ Not quite. A significant vector for COVID transmission is not just those droplets of spittle, but aerosol produced by exhaling -- tiny particles that stay suspended in the air, persisting and remaining infectious for hours, able to infect at long-range. Think smoke, not spittle. @_Fuzzgun @Clean_Air_Club_ This is why surgical masks are not as effective as tightly-sealed N95 or similar respirators. Pretty much any face covering will block big droplets, but unless it's sealed around your face, aerosols leak in and out, filling the vicinity. Without ventilation, this happens quickly.
