# an utter failing

It is an utter failing of public health messaging that 99.99% of people don't know that SARS-CoV-2 suppresses the mechanisms by which your body normally recruits adaptive immune response. You don't need to be an immunologist to understand the significance of this. We've known this for the vast majority of this pandemic. We knew it loooooooong before the first "Herd Immunity is Finally Here!" article. Even before we knew about long COVID, we knew getting infected was NEVER a good idea, even if you were "low risk."
