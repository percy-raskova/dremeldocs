# d him with a long, nuanced message about who we can and...

@swoletariat69 Lol. We used to be mutuals until I DM'd him with a long, nuanced message about who we can and cannot work with, he skipped over the nuance, said "Don't put this shit in my DMs," then unfollowed me ðŸ™„ @swoletariat69 From his bio: "The fundamental task of the US left is to #DemExit."

Mf thinks "the US left" means people who are currently entrenched in the Democratic party ðŸ¤£
