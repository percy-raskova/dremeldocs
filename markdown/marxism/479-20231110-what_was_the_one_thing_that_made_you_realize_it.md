# What was the one thing that made you realize it was ALL...

What was the one thing that made you realize it was ALL bullshit? That you have been misled your entire life, that liberalism is not peace, that capitalism is not the only option, that the world is run on an empire of blood, etc.

For me, it was reflecting on "Israel," at age 16. They sent me to "the promised land," bragged about ethnic cleansing, and cemented my opposition to the entire prospect of a "Jewish state." Their only arguments were appeals to my faith -- which I had already abandoned. Without "god promised us this land," they had nothing. And without the supposed inherent goodness of "Israel," the nature of the entire edifice of the US empire suddenly started clicking. It was ALL imperialism. It was all a lie. Billions of human beings, ground into paste for the valorization of western capital.
