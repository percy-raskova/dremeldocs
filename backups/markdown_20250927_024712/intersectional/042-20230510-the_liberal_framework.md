# the liberal framework

@genderlessflesh The object of pluralism within the liberal framework is to assimilate as many distinct identities as they can to undermine support for political liberation. They then ostracize, criminalize, and violently reject all who refuse to let their identities be co-opted. @genderlessflesh Who gets assimilated? Those who benefit from the hegemony, regardless of identity; those of *class* privilege. For them, it's a matter of "acceptance." For us, it's a matter of survival. They are compradors.
