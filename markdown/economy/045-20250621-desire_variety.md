# desire variety

Alright, guess that answers the question of how cooking at home could possibly be more expensive than eating out: people are buying ingredients for 6 meals and then throwing away 5 of them because they "desire variety" and "simply will not live that way." https://t.co/p1IS3wVkDo Sorry it's getting so expensive to eat steak one night and lobster the next ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Truly, this is an untenable economic position. The people are crying out for relief from the burden of meeting their basic needs, like never being forced to eat leftovers.

Could you get more entitled?
