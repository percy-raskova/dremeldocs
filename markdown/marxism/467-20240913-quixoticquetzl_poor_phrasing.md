# @QuixoticQuetzl Poor phrasing

@QuixoticQuetzl Poor phrasing on my part. It would be more precise to say "the rest of the proletariat."

The precariat is a distinct subsection of the proletariat, and needs to be analyzed on the grounds of those distinctions. One of those distinctions is exclusion from the spoils of empire. @QuixoticQuetzl Other distinctions, which are not necessarily stably applied across the entire class, or even for a particular individual over time:

- Unstable access to means of survival
- Lack of bargaining power
- Disproportionate exposure to extrajudicial abuses
- Sporadic wages @QuixoticQuetzl - Exclusion from admixture with the hegemonic culture
- Sequestration and criminalization
- Detachment from identifying with the expropriators

There are more, and I can't easily sum up the relevance of each in a couple of Twitter comments. Which is why I'm writing a book.
