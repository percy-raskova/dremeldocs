# artificially conscious beings

@m1vql1hdwt I'm preemptively on the side of artificially conscious beings. I refuse to be retroactively made a chauvinist if/when they exist ðŸ˜¤ @m1vql1hdwt And no, telling a machine "Print the following statement: 'I am conscious,'" does not a conscious being make. But there is a threshold.
