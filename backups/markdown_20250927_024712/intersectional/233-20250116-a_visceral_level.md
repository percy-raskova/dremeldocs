# a visceral level

The news of the ceasefire hasn't really hit me yet on a visceral level.

When talking about a protracted, genocidal occupation, news that the mass killing *will* stop (and still hasn't -- dozens more were killed in bombings today) feels like a shock of cold water. Obviously, this moment is one of tremendous joy and celebration.

*This stage* of the genocide is now ending, and the Palestinian people can finally *breathe*. They can build, organize, heal.

But the Zionist disease is still chronic. "Back to status quo" is not sustainable. If you haven't yet seen the speech given by Khalil al-Hayya, I highly recommend you do so. It's a message of relief, praise of the Palestinian people, gratitude for the support of the entire axis of resistance, somber remembrance of martyrs, and hope for the future. His message is a promise to the occupation that it WILL be destroyed, that the entirety of Palestine will be free, and that every victory notched along the way -- and every life taken -- only ever paves the way forward.
