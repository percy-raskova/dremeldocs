# such a constant stream

There is such a constant stream of sniping and doomerism and pettiness that I feel is strictly counterproductive. Yes, there are a lot of things we need to hammer out if we want to be an actual movement, but what you see on social media is not that. It's just childish jabs. Honestly, though, I am legitimately optimistic. I can see in real time a growing consciousness and thirst for understanding. I see people studying, I see people organizing, I see people acting.

Our movement is young, it's clumsy, it's disorganized. But we're learning. We're learning to discard liberal beliefs and methods. We're learning to detect and excise opportunism and collaborationism. We're learning good instincts and good practice.

Most importantly, we're learning revolutionary history -- and learning to embrace it as OUR history. In this way, through both study and practice of our revolutionary heritage, our movement stops being young. We regain our memory and begin to work from a place of experience, instead of aimlessness and naivety.

Because our movement is actually very, very old. And it is strong. So chin up! The pessimism and cynical ploys are all just growing pains as we enter our movement's adolescence. We're arguing about things we (collectively) don't understand. But we (collectively) are getting closer.

Look forward to the days when we're arguing over real things!
