# @leozh @katewillett

@leozh @katewillett You're accusing me of creating a straw man after literally saying leftists who distrust market-based solutions are NIMBYs who want to do nothing.

In places where there ACTUALLY aren't enough homes (this doesn't include the homes being hoarded), of course we need to build more. @leozh @katewillett WE need to build more. Not developers. Not investment firms and landlords and the exact same people holding housing hostage. Fully publicly-owned housing, offered at low or no cost to the people who need it.
