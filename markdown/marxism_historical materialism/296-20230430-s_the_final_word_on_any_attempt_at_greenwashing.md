# s the final word on any attempt at greenwashing, any praise...

Here's the final word on any attempt at greenwashing, any praise of "climate progress," any self-congratulations by capitalist mouthpieces:

Carbon emissions have continued to grow, completely uninterrupted by *any* of these market-focused plans, treaties, and legislation. https://t.co/58zH9Ws7Vv Whatever statistical maneuvering or meandering reasoning they throw at you, the sum total is the same. The atmosphere doesn't give a shit about "emissions per unit GDP." The greenhouse effect pays no heed to the falling cost of solar panels.

It's about the carbon.
