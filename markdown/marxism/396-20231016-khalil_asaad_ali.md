# Khalil Asaad Ali

A couple of days ago, the Zionists killed an elderly married couple in their home in Shebaa: Khalil Asaad Ali and Riad Hussein Akoum. Both were older than the Nakba itself. When I was a kid, my Jewish school taught us about the Holocaust every year. We often had Holocaust survivors come speak to us about their experiences, to give us the human perspective. It was chilling to hear the horrors we had learned about in books come out of someone's mouth. In the eighth grade, my class took part in a project called Shalshelet, or "Chain." We put together a documentary, interviewing survivors to create a "chain of testimony," where we would carry their firsthand experience with us. We were told Holocaust denial would thrive as the generation of victims died out. That it was our duty to keep the chain going, so that no one could claim we were exaggerating. So that we could ask as bulwarks against it happening again. Where is the chain of testimony for the Nakba? The Zionists are attempting to break that chain right now. Before our eyes, they slaughter the last generation that lived through it. But Israel itself is the testimony. As long as it exists, everyone can see the Nakba firsthand.
