# the primary hurdle

@ecomarxi This sort of thinking is a prerequisite to revolution, but the primary hurdle is that it's not *enough*. Self-sustaining food production, sure. What about clothing production? What about medicine? Materials for housing/repairs? Creature comforts? Security? @ecomarxi To be truly self-sustaining requires massive infrastructure, which *could* be built out over time with enough people and access to raw materials/land. The second you start doing that in a way that challenges the capitalist order, tremendous state violence will come down on you. @ecomarxi And that's what we call revolution.

So yes, we do need to build self-sustaining infrastructure. We also need to be ready to defend it and expand it. Otherwise we are all dead, and everyone we leave behind will be trapped in a brutal system forever.
