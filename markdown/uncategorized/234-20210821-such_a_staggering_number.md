# such a staggering number

I honestly have no idea how such a staggering number of people have the attention span for professional sports. I could probably enjoy watching football if it was just play after play for 15 minutes straight, instead of 15 minutes of action spread across 3 mind-numbing hours. It's a pretty tactical game at its core, kind of like chess with real (giant) people. But of course, it needs to make a profit, so it needs 25 minutes of ads per minute of play time. If you wanted to watch a 1 minute video, you would not sit through a 25 minute unskippable ad.
