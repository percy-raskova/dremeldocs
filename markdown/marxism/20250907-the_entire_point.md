# The entire point

This is in our SOP btw. The entire point of an organization is to coordinate resources and labor in a way that uses them more effectively and intentionally than individuals ever could. Don't just guess: plan. You need to be taking censuses, budgeting, and tracking distribution. https://t.co/I0HXkutE7d Make yourselves an institution. The entire community should know who your organization is and be able to count on your support being a regular, sustained service. Same times, same places, same protocols. Don't promise what you can't deliver. Keep track of your resources and always underestimate your labor capacity in case of emergency. You need to be constantly expanding your scope as soon as you have the means, and not a second before. Having standard operating procedures is vital for rapid onboarding and turnaround. New members should be ready to contribute as quickly as possible. New resources should be apportioned to your constitutive programs as soon as they're secured. You are not here to assuage your liberal guilt, nor are you "servants of the people." You are here to *strengthen* the masses. Nourish the body, nourish the mind. The more you do now, the more you and your community are *able* to do in the future. This isn't charity. It's duty. It's keeping your family fed and a roof over their heads. These aren't props for your morality play, they are your people.
