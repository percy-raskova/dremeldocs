# the N95 mask's ability

95 refers to the N95 mask's ability to filter at least 95% of airborne particulates of at least 0.3 microns. This is the grade of mask filtration considered acceptable for reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles through the air.6 6 is the number of feet apart recommended for preventing errant aerosolized virus-containing droplets from reaching another person, in the event they are not stopped by proper masks. 10 is the number of air changes per hour recommended to ensure proper ventilation and dispersal of viral particles in the air. 15 is the number of minutes it is considered safe to be in the vicinity as someone infected with SARS-CoV-2, as long as these other standards are met. Unmasked, non-distanced, and unventilated conditions drop this number to 0. Even when wearing masks, 6 feet apart, in a well-ventilated room, if you are spending more than 15 minutes with someone, you are rolling the dice that they do not have COVID. The vaccines are over 95% effective at prevent serious cases, but they are only about 66% effective at preventing infection--and therefore transmission. Remember that you are not only trying to protect yourself, you are protecting millions of unvaccinated children.
