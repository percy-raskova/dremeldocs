# an especially difficult pathogen

Candida auris is not an especially difficult pathogen for a healthy immune system to fight off: candidiasis is typically thought of as primarily hospital-acquired, spreading rapidly among those with weakened immune systems (thanks to shamefully lax transmission controls) https://t.co/GcmCwUfGVn Since the beginning of the pandemic, it has gone from practically non-existent to a significant public health concern in the broader public. This is one of many reasons the ongoing degradation of population health, driven by SARS-CoV-2, is more than just the virus itself.
