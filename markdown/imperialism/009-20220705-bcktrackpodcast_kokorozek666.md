@BckTrackPodcast @kokorozek666 @patsoc_moments Pretty basic history tbh. Following the French and Indian war, Britain issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which forbade settlers from expanding west of the Appalachians. This was instantly disregarded by settlers, and tensions escalated until the war for independence. @BckTrackPodcast @kokorozek666 @patsoc_moments "America was founded on genocide" is not just referring to initial European settlement on the continent. It's a statement of the fact that the reason the USA is separate from the British empire is because (wealthy, landowning) Americans wanted to do more genocide.
