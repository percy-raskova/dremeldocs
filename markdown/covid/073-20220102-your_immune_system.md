# your immune system

@BmoreBaker42 @BatResearch The virus that causes COVID-19 can do nothing to you or kill you, because it screws with your immune system. It slows your immune response, which is why you can spread without symptoms, but also causes widespread inflammation. This paper looks at the molecular reasons why. @BmoreBaker42 @BatResearch Of note is the proinflammatory molecules. One of the main ways COVID kills you is because your immune system basically blasts everything to bits, and it's because infected immune cells are producing way more of the stuff that normally leads to less-deadly levels of inflammation.
