# the most concise explanation

I was recently trying to explain the distinction between "gang" and "cartel," and I think this is probably the most concise explanation. Gangs aren't entities built around conducting a particular business, they're more like interpersonal infrastructure maintaining subsocieties. https://t.co/yIIUwce6Vb Gangs are organizations that set up/maintain an alternative framework beyond "formal labor," much like how a "true state" maintains the framework for formal labor. "Formal" and "legitimate" and "true state" are all relative, dictated by -- in this case -- the bourgeois state. Everything outside that which is granted legitimacy (i.e. bourgeois-led) is lumpen.
