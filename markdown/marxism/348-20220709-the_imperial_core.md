# the imperial core

Getting sick of people acting like everything is hopeless and the spirit of communism is dead in the imperial core.

Yes, there are a lot of unserious "leftists" online, distracting from the movement being built. No, you don't have to "deal with them" before you can get started. https://t.co/VVVi2u88tq The left in the West is facing a crisis not of ideology, but of central organization. It's not as if westerners are magically unable to unshackle themselves from liberalism or grasp Marxism! We have so many true comrades already: they just need to know what to do and where to go! You don't have to just sit around and feebly wait for some perfect revolutionary vanguard to come along! Right now, you can be helping and educating your community, building those networks of solidarity that will be crucial for enacting coordinated mass actions. And if you don't currently have the bandwidth to do that? That's fine too. But keep your focus on *becoming* able to do the necessary work. Don't just sit around feeling hopeless and imagining that everyone else must feel the same.
