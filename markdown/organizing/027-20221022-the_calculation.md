# the calculation

If you're making the calculation between joining CPUSA and doing nothing, I would obviously rather you join CPUSA. Or FRSO. Or PSL.

Any complaint I have about these orgs revolves around my assessment that their strategies do not work, not that they're ideological enemies. There are many structural problems with CPUSA that are preventing it from acting as the vanguard party it was founded to be. I support the rank-and-file members who see those issues and are trying to fight them. But I don't see that as my struggle.
