# m not in the best headspace today, so maybe I

I'm not in the best headspace today, so maybe I'm being a bit uncharitable, but seriously fuck this disgusting, pernicious, pervasive current of anti-intellectualism on the "left." Education is not oppression it is the exact fucking opposite. I'm sorry the capitalist school system traumatized you: it traumatized me too, and everyone else, especially poor and racialized children. But you are a complete fool if you think that looks anything like what an education system liberated from the shackles of capital looks like. Communists throughout history have launched the most successful literacy programs in human history every time they achieved a modicum of power. Waves of liberated minds, able to engage with the world and act upon it, instead of being exploited for their bodies. Education is what made us human. We experimented and taught each other and carried forth a legacy of curiosity and agency unprecedented in the previous billions of years of life. Imagining education *itself* as inherently a tool of oppression serves only the oppressors.
