# re always 

I keep hearing people talk about how economics is not a zero-sum game, because we're always "growing the pie," so as the economy grows, *everyone* becomes better off on average. This is the standard argument for completely unregulated market capitalism: it leads to growth for all What they always seem to ignore is that that growth *itself* is a zero-sum game. The pie is actually growing, but the amount it grows by is its own pie. More and more, working class people aren't getting even a tiny piece of that pie. The argument against capitalism isn't that it doesn't create economic growth. It's that that growth is worthless for the vast majority of people. We get to see billionaires gain more billions. Meanwhile, we've already eaten all the pie in our tiny slice, and we need more.
