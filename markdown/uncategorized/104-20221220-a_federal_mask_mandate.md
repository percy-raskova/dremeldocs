# a federal mask mandate

If the government issued a federal mask mandate TODAY, there would be a lot of grousing and non-compliance. But the vast majority of people would go "Oh, I guess this is serious again," and start wearing them. Especially if they sent N95s to everyone. Which is, of course, why they will never mandate masks again. Because if people start thinking this is serious, there are a whole more implications than just wearing a mask.

For example, they might start asking why they don't get guaranteed paid time off to quarantine.
