# Stalin defenders

@SherylWeikalLaw I think the "Stalin defenders" (at least the ones who aren't just fascists in disguise, like Patsocs) are reflexively pushing back against decades of anticommunism. The question is always "Why is it so important to you to prove Stalin was a bad dude?" @SherylWeikalLaw If someone came up to me and said "Do you or do you not admit that Jews are more wealthy than average?" my first and only question would be "Why the FUCK are you asking???"

It is literally true, but the only context in which I've ever heard that was as a prelude to antisemitism. @SherylWeikalLaw As always, it's about nuance. Stalin did a lot of really important, good work. He also made a lot of mistakes. He also did a lot of stuff that there is no excuse for. A true communist needs to be able to sort out which is which and then build a better, just socialism.
