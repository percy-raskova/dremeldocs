# call out

I am so sickened by liberal-brained hand-wringing, whose first instinct is to "call out" and "shame" right-wing voices for their rhetoric inciting this kind of violence.

You're not shaming them. You're not forcing them to reflect on their "mistakes."

THIS IS THEIR ENTIRE GOAL Every conservative pundit and politician and think tank out there peddling the core tenets of fascist ideology is doing so deliberately. They are all in on fascism, they simply would never get their hands dirty like this. But they are JUST as culpable. And just as they are culpable for giving oxygen to the flames of fascism with their vast reach, the broader society is culpable for giving *them* oxygen.

By allowing them to hold office, to have space on airwaves, to launder capital into culture-crafting, the state is culpable. Such a pernicious project and the inevitable violence it demands would NEVER survive in a socialist state.

Similarly, an equal and opposite project, fostering the liberatory politics of communism, would be snuffed out in an instant by this same state that bolsters fascism.
