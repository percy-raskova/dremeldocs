# @biggav @bidetmarxman

@biggav @bidetmarxman Yes, the US used and has continued to use every bit of its economic and military hegemony to crack pan-Arabism. Coups, sanctions, invasions, etc. My point was that it has consistently used Israel as the *fulcrum* for several of these levers. @biggav @bidetmarxman For example, Israel's seizure of Sinai, and thereby the territorial security of the vital Suez canal, was helpful as a point of negotiation with Egypt to bring it further in line with US interests.
