# the fundamental reproductive cell

The nuclear family is the fundamental reproductive cell of bourgeois culture. Calling any glimpse of departure from that model a result of "capitalist atomization" is as much an error as attributing queerness to "bourgeois degeneracy". Stop naturalizing hegemonic relations. https://t.co/I6FXPssDKz The real problem with The Ethical Slut and its associated ethos is that it attempts to assimilate non-traditional family structures *within* that hegemony, rather than striving for the sublation of the bourgeois family form. Not that the divergence itself is "individualistic."
