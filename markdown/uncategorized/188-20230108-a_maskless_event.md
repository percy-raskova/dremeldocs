# a maskless event

@iseeuliars Taking your mask off to eat or drink means it was essentially a maskless event.

Obviously it's *better* to spend *most* of the time with a mask than none at all, just like it's better to wear an imperfectly-sealed KN95 than nothing. But you're not "doing everything right." @iseeuliars "Sure, I just flew to Europe, and no one else was wearing a mask, but I was!"

WOW! You went 10 hours without drinking??? I wish I had your stamina!
