# so many vague "lefties

@m1vql1hdwt It evidently is useful in *some* capacity, given that so many vague "lefties" feel drawn to the ~romance~ of the autonomous collective. It's not particularly useful for Marxists, but it's a good illustration of the foibles of anarchist tendencies. @m1vql1hdwt That is, I don't think we're in some desperate need of a hardcore autopsy to tease out all the complex theoretical flaws. We just need a documentary blasting all the nonsense on full display. Like watching a nature documentary and marveling at it.
