# the lithium batteries

@KirbyHonest "Furthermore, the lithium batteries used annually by disposable vapes alone is the same amount of lithium batteries necessary to create 2,600 electric vehicles."

1,200,000 electric vehicles were sold in 2023. Vapes had 0.18% of the cobalt use of electric vehicles lmao. @KirbyHonest These people clearly just found this article and gobbled it down uncritically.
