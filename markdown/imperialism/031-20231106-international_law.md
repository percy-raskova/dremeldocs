# international law

In accordance with international law, hundreds of thousands of Zionist settlers need to get out of the West Bank immediately. Weird how "international law" hasn't meant shit this whole time, despite having absolutely no room for interpretation there. https://t.co/E7bmbtZNms Even setting aside the criminal existence of "Israel" itself, they have literally not stopped disobeying "international law" once since they started. The worst they've gotten is a ðŸ˜• react from the UN, and billions of dollars in US support every year.
