# 1.6 billion people

China, Vietnam, Laos, Korea, and Cuba have 1.6 billion people combined. Their communist parties are unambiguously secular, and their populations are the least religious on the planet. Religion is tolerated, but it's not seen as a social good, let alone "central to communism." https://t.co/fOXDHdbBYW And those are just *states* that are led by communist parties. There are many active insurgencies as we speak that are led by -- or include in coalition -- thoroughly secular communist parties. A wide variety of tendencies, yet all secular in their ideology, including the PFLP. Atheist communists are neither an aberration nor a coincidence. You can cite whatever anecdotes you want about "communists I've met," but the fact remains that revolutionary communist organizations throughout history have always seen religion and communism as mutually opposed.
