# the current paradigm

It's pretty simple. Space is cool, but under the current paradigm, it's just another profit seeking venture. We don't hate the concept of exploring the stars, we hate who's doing it, why they're doing it, what they will gain from it, and what they're willing to do to get it. https://t.co/HUFOJxXz1Q A good analogy is the so-called "age of exploration," in which Europeans swarmed over the planet, enslaving entire continents, carving the land into plantations and mines, and set the stage for the utter immiseration of billions, all in the name of profit. Humans had been exploring for hundreds of thousands of years, spreading across every habitable landmass, pioneering new cultures, technologies, and ways of life as they went. Exploring and adapting is the heritage of our species, and these monsters poisoned that legacy for power. Do not get suckered into the false promise of "Sure, capitalists are doing it for their own benefit now, but their greed will still advance humanity's horizons." We do not need them. We do not support their avarice in the hope of trailing along in their wake. Do you think the eastern and western hemispheres would never have reached each other, if not for the rapacity of the colonists and slavers? Do you think we would never reach the stars without the capitalists seeking to hollow out Mars? Right now, our ONLY goal is eliminating those social structures that keep us tied to this Earth, billions of us in chains. We do not assent to the quest to mine asteroids and harvest new material to build more of those chains. Only when we are all free will we reach the stars.
