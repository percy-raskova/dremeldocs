# the legitimate criticisms

@hankgreen I certainly apologize for assuming that you were being unreasonably snarky about the legitimate criticisms.

To clarify: this was not about John "not masking on public transit," but about him -- and everyone else -- not masking at a conference dedicated to an airborne illness. @hankgreen And more to the point, the way in which both he and you have joined in with the overwhelming majority of people in ignoring the ongoing scourge of COVID. It has not magically gone away, nor have its myriad long-term and wide-reaching effects. @hankgreen I'm sure you can understand that this frustration is especially potent *because* of who you are. You, of course, are "the science brother." And John has dedicated so much effort to getting across the message that TB is shamefully ignored by the most privileged in our world. @hankgreen Basically, a lot of us feel so completely abandoned by so many of the systems we thought we could rely on. Sources of information and systems of aid -- all have fallen away and condemned us to suffer in silence. No one wants to have that extend to you.
