# an excellent protocol

This is an excellent protocol. Testing early and often, and treating everyone--no matter how "severe" they are--with an antiviral has always been the obvious brute force strategy. However, I worry that even this might be insufficient for true eradication. https://t.co/6Hfart6vtq They seem to only treat with antivirals until patients test negative. Just like we've seen with Paxlovid in the U.S., that is often insufficient for complete viral clearance. It reduces, but does not abrogate the chances of developing long COVID. I'm not a doctor, obviously, nor am I especially familiar with the risks of larger antiviral doses or the logistical issues of producing more doses. But I would love to see studies examining the impact of continuing antiviral treatment long past the negative test. Either way, it is absolutely a MASSIVE roadblock in the path of transmission, and undoubtedly can lead to an *effective* reproductive number &lt;1, meaning the virus could eventually be stamped out (assuming this strategy is kept up until it is truly gone). Short of total eradication, this also just means life is easier for individuals and society at large. Massively lower cases, lower chance of developing long COVID, an unburdened health care system, etc.

You know, the things the U.S. is gaslighting us into thinking are true here.
