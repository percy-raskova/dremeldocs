# social dominance

@rednewafrikan I think part of it has to do with the role of masculinity as a construction of social dominance, meaning the embrace of femininity feels like a natural extension of rejecting the curse of being socially expected to dominate others. @rednewafrikan Moreover, that comes with its own expectations, a sort of "check your humanity at the door before you enter." So not only did we not even ask to be let in, we also get treated with disgust when we're found and get interrogated: "Why do you still have that? Who let you in here??" @rednewafrikan I know that sounds uncharitable to people who are totally comfortable with their masculinity, and don't or can't use it to dominate other, including trans men (who now also have to navigate that same interrogation). But that's the best illustration I can conjure at the moment.
