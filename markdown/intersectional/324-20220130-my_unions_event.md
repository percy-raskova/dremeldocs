# my union's event

@SocialismS4A A couple years ago, I attended my union's event to educate people on how to navigate home buying. The speaker pointed out that what happened in the last housing crisis, where they gave out loans to people who couldn't afford them, was happening again under a different name. @SocialismS4A This time the goal isn't to essentially bet on the market and create wealth out of nowhere. It's to drive spikes in demand, enticing current homeowners to sell to giant corporations. Then once the unsustainable loans become too much, the new borrowers also sell or get foreclosed. @SocialismS4A Now suddenly the areas where people had demonstrated high enough desire for housing that they were willing to take out these shady loans are entirely owned by one giant landlord who can charge whatever rent they can get away with.
