# classified information

So let me get this straight:

The Department of Energy gave the WSJ "classified information" -- which has not been revealed -- that led them to conclude with "low confidence" that the virus came from a lab leak.

Seems very scientific. I am convinced. By the way, Jesus rode dinosaurs and I have pictures to prove it.

BUT, the pictures turn invisible if you try to look for them. I have absolutely no reason to doubt the veracity of a state agency claiming a foreign power is responsible for a global disaster, based on secret information that took them 3 years to get, and which no other investigation around the world has found.
