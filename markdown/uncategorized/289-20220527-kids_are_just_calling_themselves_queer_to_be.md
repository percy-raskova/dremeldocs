# kids are just calling themselves queer to be trendy

One of the craziest things about the "kids are just calling themselves queer to be trendy!" argument is... So what?? Even if that was true, that's clearly not the actual reason you give a shit, or we'd see just as many apocalyptic rants about Fortnite and TikTok dances. Some queer kids feel an INTENSE disconnect from the identities ascribed to them, know for a fact what they are, and denying them that destroys them.

Some are still exploring who they are. You know, like kids have always done. What you're *actually* scared of is that these old systems of social control are holding less and less sway over each new generation.

Many of these kids calling themselves queer literally just don't think those roles have any real meaning, and are fine calling themselves queer. So yes, Bill Maher. It's entirely possible we're a couple of generations away from 100% "queer." That wouldn't actually represent any change about how society works. People will still have personal sexual preferences, enjoy football, wear perfume, etc. Why do you give a shit?
