# @CreeperNigga "Jew" is a modern term used to describe...

@CreeperNigga "Jew" is a modern term used to describe anyone of a variety of ethnicities (Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Mizrakhi, etc.) that share a common heritage tracing back thousands of years to the Levant, prior to multiple diaspora events. Our ancestors called themselves Ivrim, or Hebrews. @CreeperNigga One of the reasons multiple ethnic groups have the term "Jew" attached is because, throughout that long history, the traditional faith most of us held was Judaism, a religion as varied as the people who hold it.

I don't hold that faith, because I don't believe in god. @CreeperNigga The reason I still call myself a Jew despite not following the Jewish faith is for the same reasons people identify with any ethnicity--many of which don't have an associated traditional faith. It's where I come from, and it's how others see me, for better or worse.
