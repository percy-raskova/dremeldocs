# empire gives materially and takes ideologically in equal...

@KSBolshevik This is true from a milsci standpoint, but the gulf between us and them in the war of position is still massive. The reason we have access to that materiel is the same as the reason we broadly decline to use it. @KSBolshevik The empire gives materially and takes ideologically in equal measure. Anyone who claims the empire cannot be defeated militarily has traded political consciousness for the same goods and services that would benefit the political project they have no will to undertake.
