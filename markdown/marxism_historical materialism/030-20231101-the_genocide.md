# the genocide

He's not upset at the genocide. He's upset that Israel has completely abandoned the pretense of the believable lie. No one believes bombing a refugee camp because "There might have been an unnamed terrorist in there" makes sense -- unless they want the refugees dead anyway. https://t.co/iDPLsvYa60 Liberalism is just a veneer of respectability slapped on top of fascism, and it is frustrating for the liberals to see that veneer being stripped away so sloppily.

How far will they go to defend the illusion? Historically, not very far. They will buckle or they will be replaced. Instead, what we are seeing is the savviest of ideological actors working hard to *convert* the veneer. For example, redefining their precious myth of "peaceful protest" to exclude protest against genocide. The culture must change, the law must change, the Volk must change. The slow march of fascism has become a full-on sprint these past few years. Every crisis is a new exercise in how quickly liberalism can hide its nature; a new experiment to train for the ultimate crisis, for which the only saving grace of bourgeois society can be fascism.
