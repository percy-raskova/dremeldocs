# Not infant mortality

@Rocko64_ Not infant mortality, just child rearing. Your various biological systems--immune system, DNA repair, wound healing, cancer prevention, etc.--start to break down pretty quickly past peak childbearing age. There's a ton of selective pressure to maintain those things early on. @Rocko64_ Humans are very social creatures, so the "grandparent hypothesis" posits that there has been *some* selective pressure for longevity: if you live long enough, you can continue to help your kin survive through your expertise. But the selection for that is weaker than reproduction. @Rocko64_ The parallel is that medical technology and policy only needs to get people through the period of life when they're most useful to capital. Exorbitant cost of elder care selects for those with money, who are more likely to be invested in the system that gave them that money.
