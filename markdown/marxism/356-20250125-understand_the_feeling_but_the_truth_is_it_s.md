# understand the feeling but the truth is , it 's * always *...

I understand the feeling but the truth is, it's *always* a bad time to be part of an oppressed population. We'll always have to fight for liberation until the day we are liberated. Today has become the best time to do that. Yesterday would have been better, but yesterday is over. https://t.co/gaPhSm3U0C The image you're conjuring of a "better time" to be trans was a brief period with scattered pockets of facile, liberal "acceptance." Acceptance is not and has never been liberation. It's putting makeup on the bruises. It's "I'm sorry baby, I didn't mean it" in the cycle of abuse. The supposed "reprieve" was never a stable, holistic reversal of the conditions that created the abuse in the first place. Depending on what material forces govern your existence, you may have *never* known that reprieve at all.

https://t.co/xBod0YZ5dQ Other oppressed cohorts, especially oppressed nationalities, have shared in this experience you are now facing. Shifting *cultural* attitudes toward *some* members of a social class that allows *some* of them to escape abject immiseration. But it's all tenuous. There was a time when, among "enlightened, respectable liberals," it was not ok to be transphobic, to be racist, to use the "no-no words," to outright support eliminationist policies.

You could, of course, be "tough on crime," "tough on immigration," "tough on China," etc. The seamlessness with which the liberal mainstream can become acculturated to abandoning their conception of pluralism by simply shifting the conversation isn't shocking. The only reason "diversity as a value" existed in the first place was to maintain bourgeois hegemony. "Acceptance" is a house of cards, built on the shaky ground of assimilation. All it takes to knock it over is a sizable, economically powerful faction stomping in unison that they refuse to even accept assimilation. Their interests were always more important than ours. That is why we don't fight for acceptance. We fight for liberation. We fight to completely strip away the power of capital, because as long as capital exists, those who hold it dictate who and what is even allowed to *exist*, let alone thrive. And yes, despite some scattered concessions to "pluralism" that have allowed a few outsiders, to grab some for themselves, capital remains to this day predominantly in the hands of those who first carved it from the flesh of everyone else. And they have a death grip on it. So no, you did not become trans at the worst time to be trans. Now is the best time to be trans, because now is the only time we have.

Now is the time to join the fight for liberation.
