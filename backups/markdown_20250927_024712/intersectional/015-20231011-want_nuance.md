# want " nuance " 

You want "nuance"? Ok, here's my nuanced take on the matter of civilians.

First: Israel doesn't give a shit about that. They slaughter Palestinian civilians for sport. They barely even care about *their own* civilians. Military service is obligatory. They hate civilians. Second: If you made the decision to move to an active occupation, because you were told it's your ancestral right, and your presence is necessary for creating a Jewish state, you are a blood and soil fascist. You are not a civilian. Leave immediately if you regret that decision. Third: If you were born in "Israel" or brought there as a child, you are obviously not culpable for your presence there. If you grew into an adult, and somehow missed the fact that your *continued* presence there is an act of military occupation, that is called willful ignorance. Not everyone currently being used as a pawn of the occupation is there willingly. The goal of ending the occupation does not necessarily involve mass immediate deportation of people who have known no other home. But the fact remains that the Zionists ARE using innocents as pawns. Fourth: There's no way for the resistance to distinguish between noncombatants who are there deliberately and those who are there by circumstance. They're specifically targeting military infrastructure, but BY DESIGN, Zionists have set up civilians as part of that infrastructure. The outrage being drummed up around "violence against civilians" IS THE ENTIRE PLAN. The Zionists put those civilians there for this exact purpose, as they have done for decades. They have invested billions into propaganda and recruitment of a constant stream of new settlers. For decades, they have blatantly ignored every international call for an end to the expansion of illegal settlements, knowing that no one would actually stop them. And once they had people there, they could cry foul at any attempt to chase them out. That is the role of "civilians" in this conflict. Every single civilian death is on the heads of the Zionists. Not because they "provoked" this violence through repression, but because the entire Zionist strategy revolves around fostering an entire population of human shields.
