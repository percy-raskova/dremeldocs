# SUCH a media circus

I'm honestly surprised at the way the US does elections, as one big event over the course of a single evening, rather than dragging it out across several days, or even weeks. It could SUCH a media circus, watching the official vote tallies tick up across each state every night. Candidates could travel to states where they're underperforming to shore up support. People could speculate wildly about where the percentages will end up by the close of polls. Huge plot twist swings could occur over the course of one day, fueling endless hype. Liberals would go NUTS for this. It's what they try to do for a few hours on election night, and it always falls flat because there's no time for actually building suspense. By the time results start coming in, everyone's done voting, so they're resigned to their fates. To be clear, I'm not actually advocating for this. I'm just saying, the whole bourgeois democratic system is already such a dog and pony show, and it's bizarre that they're failing to live up to their full potential of empty pomp.
