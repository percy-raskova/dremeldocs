# a political campaign

@daveforbmore My brother once had the idea to run a political campaign that just frames every issue in terms of how it benefits dogs.

The military? Dog owners shouldn't be sent off to die! Disarm now!

Union rights? Better pay and better hours gives dogs more time with their humans! @daveforbmore Dogs would die if there was a nuclear war, so we need unilateral disarmament NOW.

Climate change? Dogs overheat really easily.

Healthcare? We need universal coverage for all dogs, and also all the humans they love so much.

Etc.
