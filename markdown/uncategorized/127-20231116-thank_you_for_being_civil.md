# Thank you for being civil

@plaidula Thank you for being civil. Also, you're the idiot, idiot.

But seriously, "my ilk" includes everyone who has ever tried -- and succeeded -- at changing things through means other than voting. For example, the French revolution, the Haitian revolution, the US civil, etc. @plaidula *civil war.

When did voting magically become the only, or even the most effective, option?
