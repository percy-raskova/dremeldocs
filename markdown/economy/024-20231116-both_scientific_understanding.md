# both scientific understanding

How about we work on having doctors that value both scientific understanding and the concept that patients and carers are capable of arriving at that same understanding themselves? https://t.co/f1299G03A9 Also, I immediately discount the medical opinion of any healthcare "professional" that doesn't take COVID seriously. Just a complete disconnect from objective reality, and it's practically universal.
