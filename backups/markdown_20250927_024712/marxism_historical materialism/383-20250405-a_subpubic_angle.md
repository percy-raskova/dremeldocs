# A subpubic angle

A subpubic angle of 120° is well outside the typical range, and would likely lead to clinical outcomes like hip dysplasia, stress incontinence, or osteoarthritis.

In reality, the pelvic variance within "biological sexes" is greater than the variance between them. https://t.co/heYOmJ4h0n Imagine splitting this color spectrum in half, and calling everything to the left of that split "male" and everything to the right "female." The difference between greenish-yellow and greenish-cyan is far less than the difference between greenish-cyan and violet. https://t.co/biu0Q9Dqdi And even *that* level of variance is tiny compared to the full electromagnetic spectrum, most of which you can't even see. With different sensory organs, you could perceive into the infrared or ultraviolet ranges, or theoretically even beyond that. https://t.co/AC40KYTDtd Wavelength is material, but color is constructed by the interplay of visual receptors absorbing specific wavelengths, molecular signalling, and neural structures interpreting those signals into a gestalt perception.

So too with "biological sex." It is perception, not phenomenon.
