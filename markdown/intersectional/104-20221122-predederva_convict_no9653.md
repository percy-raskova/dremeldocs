# @predederva @Convict_No9653

@predederva @Convict_No9653 None of the Nordic countries are socialist. Socialism is not "when the government does stuff," it's when *production itself* is in the process of being transferred from the hands of private capitalists into public ownership. Social democracies do not do this. @predederva @Convict_No9653 One critical problem with these social democracies is that, by leaving the vast majority of production in the hands of capitalists and allowing them to accumulate profit, the capitalists continue to gain political power to *roll back* the reforms, like they are doing right now. @predederva @Convict_No9653 One of my closest friends is Swedish, and she has been relaying to me for years what she's seeing in her country. As a recipient of medical welfare, her benefits have been *declining*, even as costs rise. The far right is also ascendant there.
