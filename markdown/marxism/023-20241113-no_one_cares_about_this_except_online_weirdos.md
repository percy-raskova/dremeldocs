# No one cares about this except online weirdos trying to...

"No one cares about this except online weirdos trying to destroy our movement with purity tests" is exactly what these people will be saying about trans people in a couple of years, if they aren't already. Stop tailing the backwards elements. Stop *being* the backwards elements. "How are we supposed to expand if we keep making a big deal out of chauvinism/sexual assault/supporting genocide/police collaboration/etc.?"

The argument against requiring masks only makes sense if *you* don't think it matters. Stop invoking imagined, implacable masses as cover.
