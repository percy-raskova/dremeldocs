# conspiracy theories

@deleriumfish @clairesandberg Without lapsing into conspiracy theories abt them just ignoring votes (see: huge gap btwn exit polls and vote tallies), it's bc he got 100s of millions in free advertising by media swearing up and down for a year that Bernie could never beat Trump. @deleriumfish @clairesandberg Poll after poll showed cross-party majority support for Bernie's policies. But people fell for the idea that they were alone in supporting those ideas, because the media kept framing it that way. @deleriumfish @clairesandberg There was also a veneer of unpopularity. He was the target of most attacks during debates, pundits said he made their skin crawl, etc. It wasn't that voters themselves didn't like his personality. They just got the impression that most *others* didn't like him, i.e. he can't win. @deleriumfish @clairesandberg The coalescing of other centrists around Biden right before Super Tuesday was the final nail. It capped off the narrative that everyone with a clue knew Biden was The Guy. Without an equivalent for Bernie, like Warren dropping, there was nothing to combat that narrative.
