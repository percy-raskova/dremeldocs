# Like all scientists, Marxists throughout history have...

Like all scientists, Marxists throughout history have gotten things wrong. We craft scientific theories based on the data we have. Sometimes, there are details we overlook, so we draw the wrong conclusions. Sometimes, our cultural biases taint those conclusions. Marxism as a science necessarily means cross-disciplinary study. Studying history, anthropology, archaeology, biology, geology, chemistry, materials science, climate science, and more, can all give you an increasingly well-rounded background through which to understand our world. Unlike other sciences, scientific socialism has implications for every aspect of human society. The earnest study of Marxism is necessarily disruptive to your ability to be a passive member of society. Which means, more so than other science, Marxism breeds ideology. Ideology is not a bad thing. A "non-ideological" person is simply a reactive being, who moves through life acting on unexamined biases. Ideology constructed by careful study of historical materialism is the only way to govern yourself morally in a world ruled by capital. That's why Marxism must be treated as the science it is. It's all about being principled, not dogmatic. Those principles should be: commitment to objective truth, class consciousness, and improving our material conditions.

And above all, scientific socialism requires solidarity.
