# had n't thought about it that way 

@Rocko64_ I hadn't thought about it that way. I specifically call myself a Marxist *because* of the scientific implications.

I guess I've just become inured to people calling themselves scientists while holding unscientific notions, and I don't let *them* dictate *my* self-identification. @Rocko64_ But by the same token, I guess I shouldn't let chauvinists dissuade me from calling myself Marxist-Leninist ðŸ¤” I want a simple term that lets people automatically know my particular ideology and approach, and "Marxist" clearly isn't enough for that.
