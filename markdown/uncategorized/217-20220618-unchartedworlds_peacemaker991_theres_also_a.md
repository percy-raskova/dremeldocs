# @UnchartedWorlds @peacemaker991 There's also a problem...

@UnchartedWorlds @peacemaker991 There's also a problem where the new strain looks similar enough to the one you already have immunity to, where antibodies can *recognize* it, but not *neutralize* it. This can actually hamper immune response by physically blocking new antibodies from binding to the antigen. @UnchartedWorlds @peacemaker991 This may be why omicron subvariants keep outcompeting each other: if someone is infected with BA.1, they generate BA.1 antibodies. Then BA.4 infects them, and is able to evade neutralization and reproduce quickly (and get transmitted to more victims).
