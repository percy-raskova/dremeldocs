# the popular myth

Contrary to the popular myth that successive COVID variants get progressively milder:

- BA.2 is more transmissible than omicron, and is the dominant strain

- BA.2 gives you *worse* symptoms than omicron, with a higher hospitalization rate - Vaccine effectiveness against BA.2 falls off a cliff compared to omicron: 15 weeks after a booster dose, you're down to 37% protection against infection, 56% against hospitalization.

- Prior infection with omicron does not offer good protection against BA.2 - Prior infection with BA.2 does not offer good protection against BA.4/5. 

- Expect this BA.2 wave to immediately transition into a BA.4/5 wave, as people get reinfected, thinking they're "finally" immune

- Over 45% of COVID patients still had symptoms 90 days later. Sources:
