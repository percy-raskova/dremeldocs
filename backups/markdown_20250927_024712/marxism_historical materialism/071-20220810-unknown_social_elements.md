# unknown social elements

@Rocko64_ Fascism is also adept at exploiting the regressive instincts of certain sections of the working class by drawing threads (subtly or overtly) between the interests of an incomprehensible system of financial capital and "unknown social elements". @Rocko64_ They help make sense of the system that degrades communities that are traditionally tied into industrial capital by nodding to "social decay" in the form of racial minorities, immigrants, queer people, Jews, and progressivism in general. @Rocko64_ By crafting a narrative that fits into preconceived notions that these groups are not traditionally part of the "working class" (i.e. the industrial proletariat), they help further unite regressive elements into the industrial capital faction. @Rocko64_ Meanwhile, it is trivial for them to be "proven right" by the stark inability of the financial capital faction to improve their lives--since that's obviously not the goal of that faction in the first place. They're much better positioned to animate their targets than the fincaps. @Rocko64_ And of course, certain elements of the nominal "left" fall for this bait in the form of patriotic socialism. They barely understand the physics of capital, colonialism, and hegemony, but they do seem to understand that *financial* capital is insidious. @Rocko64_ So they buy into the deliberately-crafted notion that the excesses of financial capitalism are tied to "social decay," which is really the bedrock of fascist thought. They view progressivism as a betrayal of communism, despite it being the best way to unite the working class.
