# the Indian subcontinent

@hannahwanebo Same with the multitude of famines on the Indian subcontinent during British rule. Before that, there were always crop failures, but it was the combination of being forced to prioritize cash crops over food, plus the crippling colonial "tributes" that led to mass death. @hannahwanebo Humans figured out how to survive crop failure basically as soon as we figured out agriculture: stockpile food during good years and then redistribute it during bad. Colonialism is entirely about extraction.

"Famine or no famine, Indians will breed like rabbits," said Churchill
