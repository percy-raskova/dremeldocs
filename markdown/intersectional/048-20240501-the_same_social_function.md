# the same social function

@An_Aria_Blooms Biphobia occupies the same social function as all other iterations of queerphobia -- that of regimenting society into strictly-defined, naturalized gender roles for the reproduction of bourgeois hegemony (inextricable from the patriarchal family form). @An_Aria_Blooms This is true whether we talk about biphobia as a manifestation of homophobia or whether it is the "erasure" of bisexuality from liberal narratives of queerness; both are examples of liberalism's incompatibility with non-essentialist conceptions of identity. @An_Aria_Blooms Even a growing liberal consensus that homosexuality per se can be integrated into the bourgeois family form (i.e. two c*s women or men can still be "just like any normal family"), little theoretical space can be made for conceptions of bisexuality that do not mirror that form.
