# the Cuban Marxist-Leninist revolution

I was tempted to respond to this nonsense in full, but then I remembered that there is no anticommunist drivel that liberals of any stripe can ever say that will erase the earthshattering victory of the Cuban Marxist-Leninist revolution in bringing about the Family Code. https://t.co/hrIHC7pOdu It is the greatest triumph of liberation for queer people, women, children, the elderly, and disabled people, all at once, unprecedented in world history. It took years from the start of the campaign to the codification of the law, in an astounding feat of democracy. Nearly 80,000 community meetings across Cuba were held, just to revise the proposed code -- which went through 25 drafts, based on the feedback of 6.5 million Cubans. As the Family Code changed, so did the public, who went from a slight majority opposing the previous attempt at codifying marriage equality alone into the constitution, to a two-thirds majority in favor of a comprehensive law -- the most progressive the world has ever seen. It establishes rights on everything from marriage equality, to egalitarian distribution of domestic labor, to the right of children to live in a loving, nurturing environment, to freedom from all forms of abuse for all members of the household, and so much more. It would be impossible to fully distill the code in such a brief time -- it's hundreds of articles long -- nor would it be possible to sing its praises enough. The law, as well as the process of its crafting and passage, is a model for the entire world. Suffice to say, on behalf of myself and all my fellow queer Marxist-Leninists, your scorn means less than nothing to us. In the quest for queer liberation, we have on our side a REAL movement that makes REAL progress on REAL issues.

All you have is vibes.
