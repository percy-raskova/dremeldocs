# actual, scientific data

@JustJocey09 When I first heard the term "data-driven," I thought they meant actual, scientific data about the best way students learn. Nope! They meant deliberately IGNORING the science, which tells us that the more testing you do, the WORSE students learn. @JustJocey09 So now we need more tests to figure out just how badly they're learning. And then the test companies go "Oh no, look how bad these scores are! Better pay us for more tests ðŸ˜‰"
