# Read Critique of the Gotha Programme

There are some supreme nerds quibbling over this phrase, shouting "Read Critique of the Gotha Programme!!!," thereby claiming for themselves the weighty mantle of Marx's analysis, without actually demonstrating any command of the criticism he leveled or the motivation behind it. https://t.co/QH7IV8HMiH Argue if you want, but actually state your argument, and specifically *why it matters*. "Google it!!!" is not an argument.

DSA has some fundamental flaws, but using this phrase barely registers as a blip of malfeasance. This has nothing on "Bill of rights socialism."
