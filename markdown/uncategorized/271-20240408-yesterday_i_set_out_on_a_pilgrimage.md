# Yesterday, I set out on a pilgrimage

Yesterday, I set out on a pilgrimage.

There are no gods in my world. No spirits, no magic, no metaphysical forces to entreat.

My only spirituality is a sense of sheer awe at the natural wonder of the cosmos.

And today, 500 miles from home, I gazed into the crown of heaven. I will share my journey some other time. Although there are pictures, it's utterly impossible to visually capture the depth of the immense beauty I experienced without specially crafted devices and expertise I don't possess.

I do possess words, but at the moment, they escape me.
