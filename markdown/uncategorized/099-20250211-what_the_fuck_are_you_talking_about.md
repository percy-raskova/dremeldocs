# what the fuck are you talking about

We need to start getting wayyyyyy quicker with the phrase "what the fuck are you talking about?" because this doesn't even *kind of* make sense.

People are really just logging onto X the Everything App and free associating with whatever words pop into their heads. https://t.co/ieLauLJKDR This isn't even an unproven, unsourced, misinterpreted scientific claim. It's not even a *coherent* claim. What does "Birds see your individual body parts as separate birds" even mean? How and why would one even go about testing such a thing? How would such a thing even happen? Do you really think birds are out there in the wild spotting predators and going "Oh wow, look at all those tiny birds, clustered into one large cat-like mass, somehow moving in complete unison"? Do you think they don't know the difference between bird and non-bird? There are sympatric populations of birds that are so closely related that they could theoretically interbreed, but are able to discern infinitesimal differences to allow them to specifically choose mates from their own species. And you think they think TOES are birds???
