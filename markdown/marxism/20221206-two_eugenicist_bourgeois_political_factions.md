# two eugenicist bourgeois political factions

The sheer paucity of political literacy in this country has led to this fallacious notion that scientific truth and moral courage lie somewhere BETWEEN two eugenicist bourgeois political factions.

It's the left that thinks Biden, Walensky, and the rest are committing democide. https://t.co/Jyewz7uvo3 The upswell in labor militancy in response to unmet workplace COVID protections? That's the left.

The highlighting of healthcare inequities leading to substantially higher death and disability among colonized peoples? Left.

The framing of of mass infection as eugenics? Left. If you think Democrats have betrayed us because they're too far left, it's because you've internalized the capitalist propaganda that told you what we have is the best we can hope for. I would hope this pandemic is proving just how badly the hegemonic culture misleads you.
