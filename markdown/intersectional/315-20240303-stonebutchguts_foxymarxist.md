# @stonebutchguts @FoxyMarxist

@stonebutchguts @FoxyMarxist Yes, that's exactly in line with what I'm saying: "The US" is constitutionally an empire built on the subjugation of the many nations it has designated as its colonial subjects. It can never be "a nation," because that's not what "nation" means. @stonebutchguts @FoxyMarxist My point is that "American" is assigned by that same construct to those it places as the oppressOR population. I.e. the settler population. It is a nationality, specifically in the context of the empire creating that nationality to act as the locus of colonial oppression. @stonebutchguts @FoxyMarxist It's not an "organic" nation, but neither is any nation -- nations are created by social relations. It's not a nation we should respect as having any "right" to "self-determination," it's simply an important aspect of the colonial project itself (and therefore in its undoing).
