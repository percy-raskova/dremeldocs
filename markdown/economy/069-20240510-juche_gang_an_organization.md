# @Juche_Gang An organization

@Juche_Gang An organization cannot be considered "revolutionary" without these two arms. An external arm that feeds, houses, and empowers the masses, and an internal arm that drives the political development of its members. @Juche_Gang Each arm feeds the other: it is the empowered masses who fill the ranks of the organization, and the developed members who serve the people. The basic circuit that forms the basis of all revolutionary construction.
