# social democrat

I'll be honest: I feel like my radicalization from social democrat to communist was mostly driven by watching Democrats consistently fail to take obvious and politically-expedient actions my entire life... as long as those actions would help the working class. For example, in the wake of the 2008 crisis, Democrats were gifted such a lay-up. *Everyone* hated the banks that caused the crash: they could have nationalized the banks and bragged about it for the next two years, giving them even more popular support and an expanded majority. Right now, they're complaining that they "don't have the votes" to codify abortion, instead of putting legislation on the floor, purging their ranks of all who oppose abortion, and demonstrating the party's clear position as the party of abortion (a position with 80% support). I always wanted workers to have the economic power in society. But it took an entire lifetime of watching social democracy utterly fail on every level for me to realize we can't just reform capitalism into socialism. That's *why* I started studying Marxism more seriously. Yes, my current political philosophy is now informed by in-depth study of historical materialism. But no one starts their journey with a PhD in Marxism. We all start with a sense of "Wait... that doesn't seem right..."

That's what you're looking for when educating others.
