# 1) White moves first, so they're the aggressors

1) White moves first, so they're the aggressors.

2) White's pieces are in the wrong positions, so they're breaking the rules simply by being where they are. https://t.co/1wh6SW8UbG 3) Pawns aren't civilians, they're infantry, so they're acknowledging their military is a paper tiger built on presenting the illusion of superior force while having none of the most basic ground capabilities they need. 4) Their pawns are in the back rank, meaning they're smothered, incapable of advancing, creating a defensive line, or having any chance of promotion. Again, displaying the prioritization of appearances and overwhelming force over logistics, defensibility, or sustainability.
