# no contradiction

There is literally no contradiction between indigenous liberation and black liberation, as any advanced cadre within either sphere could tell you. It is in fact the same struggle, with the same enemy, same methods, same aims, same end product. Any formulation that places them as mutually exclusive is, at best a failure to imagine non-exploitative land relations, and at worst a cynical attempt at intentionally hampering the movement.
