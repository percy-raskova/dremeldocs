#  but I think I

Maybe I'm "too woke," but I think I'd rather be on the side of the argument that doesn't think transitioning is death. https://t.co/NsISaNzu6n See, the parallel isn't abortion or gender affirming care. It's death.

"Oh, you're suffering from an unwanted pregnancy? Well, the only thing we can offer is to end your suffering with death."

"Oh, you're suffering from dysphoria? Can I offer you some sweet release?"
