# major climate bill

The "major climate bill" in reference is the Inflation Reduction Act, which is not at all a win for the environment. Sections 50264 and 50265 together create conditions under which the federal government MUST lease a total of at least 62 million acres of land for fossil fuel use. https://t.co/aemNmkbrLp It stipulates that land may not be allocated for renewable energy until at least 2 million acres of onshore and 60 million acres of offshore are leased for fossil fuels. Fossil fuels also get precedence -- fossil fuel leases must go through before renewable leases can begin. It's especially heinous to present Biden as "strong on climate," considering that the IRA allocates $369 billion over the next decade toward "climate action," (most of which is tax cuts). Compare that to the $70 TRILLION in existing fossil fuel subsidies during that period. In fact, Biden is responsible for the largest increase in those subsidies in the past decade: a 40% jump since he took office (laundered as being "in response to Russian aggression").

If trends from the past decade continue, that $70 trillion becomes $110 trillion. That is, Biden's record on climate is dedicating toward "carbon reduction" about 0.33% of the money funneled toward fossil fuels as a matter of course.

Fossil fuel remains the bedrock of the US economy, and all Biden has done is scatter a few pebbles on top of that solid stone. (This doesn't even get into how pathetic those "climate measures" are, in and of themselves. Like subsidies for "greener jet fuel," or research grants for carbon capture technology.)
