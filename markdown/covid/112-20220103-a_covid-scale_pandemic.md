# a COVID-scale pandemic

Never let anyone forget that scientists have been warning about the potential for a COVID-scale pandemic for DECADES. They predicted that it would be a respiratory disease, they predicted possible regions of origin, they even called out coronaviruses as being of greatest concern. So-called "world powers" pinky-promised that they were ready, not just to protect their citizens, but to work in concert to protect the world.

They lied through their teeth. Scientists have not been allowed to dictate policy: corporate interests have. As we enter year 3 at the worst point yet, try to remember: scientists have predicted ALL of this, and tried to warn the people in power at every step of the way.

You CAN still trust science. You canNOT trust politicians who use the phrase "following the science."
