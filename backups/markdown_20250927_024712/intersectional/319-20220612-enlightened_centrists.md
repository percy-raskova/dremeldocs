# enlightened centrists

Hitler rose to power because his supporters used political violence to project strength to a despondent populace and repress communists, while the "enlightened centrists" ignored the threat they posed, fearing communism more than fascism. https://t.co/I8uRLuUMvf In the last election before Hitler became chancellor, the Nazis had lost support, while the communists gained ground. Von Hindenburg made Hitler chancellor out of fear that communists would keep gaining power.

He understood that the Nazis were the best way to defeat communism. Specifically, the paramilitary arm of the party, NOT the electoral arm. He calculated that, by putting Hitler in a position of governmental power, it would simultaneously empower the Nazis to commit more violence against the communists and make them more invested in electoralism. Of course, while the Nazis' political violence against communists did ramp up, so did their violence against Jews, queer people, and anyone else they saw as national enemies, including liberals.

Hitler used the atmosphere of fear and violence to justify "law and order" measures. The Nazis didn't rise to power because everyone supported them. They also didn't rise to power because people "checked out of politics." They *took* power. They used every opportunity to violently suppress their ideological enemies, while liberals continued to give them cover.
