# his biggest theoretical errors

@FentanylSoup @BlackRedGuard1 His error on that front follows from what I consider one of his biggest theoretical errors: a thoroughly incomplete understanding of the nation. It bugs me so much when modern Marxists cite his work as the be-all-end-all on nations, when he demonstrably failed on that front. @FentanylSoup @BlackRedGuard1 It's also hilarious that that major failure came out of his all-consuming crusade against antisemitism -- which was a major lynchpin of reactionary politics throughout the history of the Russian empire -- and then scoundrels turn around and accuse him of antisemitism.
