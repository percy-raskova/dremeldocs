# t generally talk with people who are actively reactionary,...

Not really. I don't generally talk with people who are actively reactionary, and the "normies" I talk to in everyday life are typically super receptive to Marxist framing if you don't get *too* explicit like "And therefore, we need to violently overthrow the government!" https://t.co/pKS6wR6oli Honestly, my biggest problem is with those who don the mantle of "political engagement," but actively reject revolutionary politics. The ones who call themselves "progressives," "leftists," "[democratic] socialists," etc. These people DO feel impossible to talk to. Pretty much everyone can feel that "things are bad," in a vague sense, and can point to specific symptoms of an intrinsically destructive system. The key is whether or not they're willing to engage with investigating WHY things are bad, and what to do about it. Talking with most people is smooth sailing, because we can bond over these issues and find a common ground for how to think about them. But with the "leftists," it's like pulling teeth. They think they've done all the investigation, and have come to all the wrong conclusions. In fact, it almost feels like the *closer* these people are to my own thought process, the *more* annoying it is to talk with them if we diverge on specific concepts that should be a given -- until they get close *enough* to where we can have an honest discourse over the nuances.
