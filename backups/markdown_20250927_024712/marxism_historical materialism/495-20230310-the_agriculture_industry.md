# the agriculture industry

@plants_fanon Capitalism forces the agriculture industry to either grow in a way that maximizes profits (i.e. degenerative practices) or get edged out of the market. This in turn forces them to introduce practices that compensate for falling yields--practices that degenerate the land further. @plants_fanon Easily the single most important "technology" we can innovate to improve agricultural production is the elimination of profit-driven society, i.e. the end of capitalism.
