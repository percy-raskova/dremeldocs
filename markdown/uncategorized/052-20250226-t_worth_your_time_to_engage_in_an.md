# t worth your time to engage in an 

Is it perhaps because you decided we had some fundamental ideological disagreement that wasn't worth your time to engage in an "intellectually mature" discussion over? Or perhaps you just didn't appreciate my tone? Either way, maybe it's worth interrogating when and how you apply this purported philosophy of "engaging with those you disagree with."
