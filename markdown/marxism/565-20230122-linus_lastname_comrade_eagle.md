@linus_lastname @comrade_eagle What he offers is the same as the lure of every cult: "Yes, everything is terrible, but I have The One True Answer." His "new synthesis" is hope for the hopeless; it's appealing for those who want to reach communism, and have been frustrated by a century of apparent stagnation. @linus_lastname @comrade_eagle This is what happens when you approach Marxism from an unscientific angle. All the old thinkers were "prophets," but the prophesied salvation has never come true. So you need a new prophet to uncritically worship: someone who promises salvation is right around the corner.
