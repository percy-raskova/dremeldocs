# descends from the negroes who had joined Moses

@uncle_authority Out of curiosity, I searched for the phrase "descends from the negroes who had joined Moses' exodus," and it's literally just a bunch of the same sorts of articles claiming that Marx was racist, with the same vague citation of "it was in a letter." No actual primary source ðŸ˜‚ @uncle_authority Just a self-contained ecosystem of cranks citing other cranks, inventing the "source" whole cloth.
