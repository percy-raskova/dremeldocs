# real lacto fermentation

@alicirce I tried it a while ago, and while it did end up delicious, it wasn't real lacto fermentation. I was scared of contamination, and added vinegar at the start to give the lactobacillus an advantage. But this ended up hampering the biodiversity that would normally thrive. @alicirce This time, I have put my faith in the process, and it seems to be working. It has produced its own acid, and is even funkier than ever ðŸ¥°
