# 1: Virginia

#DemExit pt. 1: Virginia.

6% will not vote in November.

Hillary won Virginia in 2016 by 5%. A 6% margin is enough to swing an election. https://t.co/RjAhMPKYt4 #DemExit pt. 2: Minnesota.

5% will not vote in November.

Remember how 5% of people thought Amy Klobuchar was our best bet because she could deliver the Midwest, which we crucially lost in 2016? Yeah, that whole region is lost for good if Biden is the nominee. https://t.co/A2UeTyscj1 #DemExit pt. 3: Maine.

4% will not vote in November.

Maine allocates its electoral votes proportionally, so every vote matters there. Hillary won here by 3%: do we really want another state colored in red? https://t.co/MAGC6QYJM0 #DemExit pt. 4: California.

4% will not vote in November.

This state is pretty solidly blue, for now, but how many will stay home in future elections? https://t.co/DqVM3qF5wb #DemExit pt. 5: Texas.

4% will not vote in November.

This one particularly hurts, because prior to Biden's surge, this was not only projected to be a Bernie state in the primary, but polls showed he could have flipped it blue. That 4% margin was just enough to flip it. https://t.co/m1poMf60fU It just goes on and on. The Democratic party is hemorrhaging voters with every cycle. This might be the final straw for a lot of people.
