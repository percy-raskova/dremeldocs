# @abdulrahman8ya @BrentToderian

@abdulrahman8ya @BrentToderian Yes on nuclear power. But skyscrapers made of concrete necessarily have a carbon footprint, since cement is made through the decomposition of limestone, which releases CO2. Theoretically, we could invent with a new construction material, but right now, nothing can match concrete. @abdulrahman8ya @BrentToderian If we switched to a carbonless heat source to process the limestone, concrete would still account for about 4% of our current CO2 emissions. Which we could probably offset pretty easily with carbon capture ðŸ¤· Still, skyscrapers are not currently a negligible source of emissions.
