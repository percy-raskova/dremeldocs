# only around 250 million Hitlers

First of all, there are only around 250 million Hitlers in this country, and the majority of those are what I call "defaultists." Their Hitlerism is entirely contingent on the Hitlerian nature of the broader political economy. https://t.co/1Ktl4bICmN In the context of a new, non-Hitlerian hegemony, they will acquiesce, or even embrace the status quo. You achieve this by building revolution up from the bottom -- those most oppressed and most immune to the endogenous Hitlerism that is kept upright by standing on their throats. The *core* Hitlers are in the minority, and are outright outnumbered by these core anti-Hitlers, maintaining their supremacy only by sharing the spoils of exploitation with the defaultist Hitlers to bulk out their garrisons with foot soldiers and armaments. Your error in believing that this hegemony cannot be defeated is that you are trying to "convert" the foot soldiers, without having an opposing army for them to defect to, let alone making defection preferable. They don't even realize they've been conscripted in the first place. Build an army first, and begin fighting the real battle. The war itself reshapes the battlefield. The barracks are ravaged and the ruins abandoned by the CO Hitlers, shattering the material fetters holding these foot soldiers in political thrall to the regime. Some defaultists will, of course, become radicalized further in favor of the regime. Some will be radicalized against it. Most will simply be removed from the field of battle, anxiously watching to see how the war plays out, so they can side with the victor. As we continue to fight, the gravitational pull of the revolution grows exponentially, and the accretion of oppressed peoples reaches a critical mass that cannot be stopped by the faltering regime. Hitlerism begins to die the moment it is challenged in real combat.
