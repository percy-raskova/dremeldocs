# the most effective strategy

@ericoscott Not only is it possible for queer people (and black people, immigrants, women, etc.) to be part of and lead movements, it is actually the most effective strategy for driving bigotry out of our society. When we are united in material struggle, regressive misconceptions fade away. @ericoscott Obviously you will always encounter people for whom the idea of solidarity with people of other identities is a deal breaker, and who will not join the struggle. Those are the people that self-select themselves out of our struggle. Everyone who will work with us is with us.
