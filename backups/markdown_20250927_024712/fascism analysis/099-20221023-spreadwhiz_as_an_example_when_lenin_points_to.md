# @SpreadWhiz As an example, when Lenin points to...

@SpreadWhiz As an example, when Lenin points to contradiction "in chemistry: the combination and dissociation of atoms."

This is the simplest way to understand chemical reactions, but doesn't have an accounting of: free energy, temperature, interacting species, transition states, and more. @SpreadWhiz At its core, the thing we choose to focus on is the combination and dissolution. But we don't know everything about *why* the phenomenon we're focusing on occurs just through that lens. So it's useful, but not the end of the story.
