# class in drag

Race, gender, and nation are not exactly "class in drag." They are material relations, not facsimiles. These, especially the nation, are primary vectors of economic exploitation created *by* and *for* the maintenance of class society. https://t.co/BU0CgM4H0t The quoted tweet was deleted because the author realized the original phrasing was wide open to misinterpretation. So, you know. Credit for integrity 🫡

https://t.co/to4f1NyPtV Liberalism surmises these relations to be rooted in some mysterious essence, which is patently false. But the constructs themselves are not false -- they are MADE real by the economic relations they were built to uphold, and which they uphold in turn. The hegemonic construct that prizes property as the economic fulcrum of its dominion must constantly reproduce itself. It does so primarily through the nation and through the family -- and all the attendant constructs that serve to naturalize and enforce the arrangement. So a "coherent class reductionism" is the misinterpretation of the various tributaries and embankments and channels of the river system of capitalism as "distractions" from the overall flow. They feed it, direct it, shape it, and reflect it. They are as real as real gets.
