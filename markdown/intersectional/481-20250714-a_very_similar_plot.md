# a very similar plot

@probablykaffe Dremel lore: in middle school, I wrote a short story with a very similar plot, but with raspberries. I was really proud of it, but I got a D because we were supposed to be writing in the style of "classic American novels," and I guess it wasn't pro-settler enough ðŸ˜¤ @probablykaffe In the end, the kid decides the whole thing isn't worth it, steals some berries, and leaves to plant them on abandoned, overgrown plots of city land, instead of feeling humbled and grateful for being magnanimously given the gift of labor.
