# any given situation

The dynamics at play in any given situation pass through the minds of reactionaries and come out the other side completely inverted.

This is someone sleeping in public and being targeted by anti-homeless violence. The same violence defended by "women who deserve to feel safe." https://t.co/8q5frQEKyh Jordan Neely was killed in a similar way -- he was considered "dangerous" for being "disruptive" by existing in the eyeline of "decent folks." This is pervasive, with thousands of *reported* cases of vigilantism against the perceived harm that is homeless people existing. And that's just the ones that get reported on. The people society deems undeserving of dignity and having their basic needs met -- whether they're homeless, disabled, prostitutes, addicts, etc. -- are subject to death and grievous harm in droves, either actively or passively. Racialized, criminalized, ostracized people are the ones under threat. Immigrants, queer people, indigenous people, black people, and many other social categories -- whose status in society is subjected to the scorn of bourgeois sensibilities -- are demonstrably LESS safe. It should come as no surprise that the people and organizations claiming to champion the cause of "women feeling safe" are the ones who are the least interested in the *actual* safety of those cohorts most subjected to the ravages of poverty.

Including women, by the way. In the US, women are 20% more likely to be in poverty, and, as with other oppressed groups, the more precarious their position, the more their *actual* safety collapses. They become increasingly subjected to gendered violence as they get pushed further into the economic margins. Us leftists saying you don't deserve to feel safe are simply saying that your FEELINGS of safety do not trump the ACTUAL safety of oppressed people. Especially because "in the name of protecting our women!" has been used relentlessly to justify violence against those same people.
