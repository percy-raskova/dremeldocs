# my biggest problem

@CaniTerrae The lack of data is my biggest problem with any hypotheticals about extraterrestrial life. We can't say "we should expect to be latecomers" when so far we have a case study of exactly ONE. We could be the first. We could be the 6th. We could be the 5,000,000th. @CaniTerrae At the end of the day, we are necessarily approaching it through an Earth- and human-centric lens. There's no reason to think we're special, but there's also no reason to think being within the first million years of spacefaring is all that special. Someone has to be first.
