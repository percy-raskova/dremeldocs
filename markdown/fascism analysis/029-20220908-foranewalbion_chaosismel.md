# @foranewAlbion @ChaosIsMel

@foranewAlbion @ChaosIsMel In their defense, plenty of anarchists aren't colonists, they just refuse to support decolonization efforts... and unwittingly benefit from colonization at home... and when you try to educate them on how they're contributing to colonialism, they'll call *you* an imperialist... @foranewAlbion @ChaosIsMel ... and if you take action to decolonize in any way that affects them, they join forces with fascists...
