# Archived Experiments

These scripts represent early experimental approaches that have been superseded by the production implementation.

## Status: ARCHIVED - DO NOT USE

The production theme classification system uses:
- `vocabulary_builder.py` - Automated vocabulary extraction
- `theme_classifier.py` - Production classification engine
- `generate_themed_markdown.py` - Markdown generation

## Historical Reference Only

These archived scripts are kept for historical reference:
- `extract_themes.py` - Early manual theme extraction attempt
- `enhanced_theme_classifier.py` - Prototype enhanced classifier
- `build_political_vocabulary.py` - Early vocabulary builder
- Others represent various experimental approaches

All functionality has been consolidated into the production scripts.
