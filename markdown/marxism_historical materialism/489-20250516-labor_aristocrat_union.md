# labor aristocrat union

any marxist born in the west can’t revolt… all they know is mcdonald’s, labor aristocrat union, protest, be cissexual, eat hot chip &amp; lie Just getting out ahead of people who don't understand the concept of jokes: I am being hyperbolic. Revolution is absolutely possible and necessary in the US, region of birth isn't the ultimate determinant of class, class instinct isn't impossible to overcome, etc.
