# Labor aristocracy

"Labor aristocracy is an important concept for adapting Marxism to the modern context."

"Erm... Lenin never said this though????" https://t.co/ujLG9ZoGZL Lenin wasn't a god, and he didn't say everything that would ever need to be said for the entire rest of history. You people sound like the centuries of physicians who continued to unquestioningly cite Galen, even when autopsies contradicted his claims. Unlike Galen, Lenin actually did autopsies of his own. But he still didn't cure -- or even discover/characterize -- every disease that would ever emerge. It's frankly alarming that anyone calling themselves a Marxist would treat any given individual as a source of eternal truth.
