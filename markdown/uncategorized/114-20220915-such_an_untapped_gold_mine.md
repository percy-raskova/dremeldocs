# such an untapped gold mine

@uncle_authority If conservatives were truly such an untapped gold mine of revolutionary potential, where are they during revolutionary action? Where are the conservatives on the picket line? Where are the conservatives at anti-war protests? Where are the conservatives fighting for higher wages? @uncle_authority The answer is that they are the ones hiring strike-breakers. They're the ones bashing the skulls of protestors. They're the bosses denying higher wages.

And most of all, they're the ones slobbering on the boots of those who oppress us all.

They are not allies.
