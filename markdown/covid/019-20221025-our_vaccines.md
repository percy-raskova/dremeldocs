# our vaccines

We've updated our vaccines ONCE to target the variants that caused the wave that just ended. Meanwhile, half a dozen highly-virulent strains are circulating simultaneously, each having the ability to evade BA.4/5 nAbs. The bivalent booster is close to obsolete already. https://t.co/4nnugLpFp4 You should still get it if you haven't already. Protect yourself from the previous giant threat, then strap on a fitted respirator (N95 or better) to protect yourself from the next giant threat. Keep it on at all times in public spaces. This isn't complicated.
