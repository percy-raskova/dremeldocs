# Jewish culture

By the way, what aspect of "Jewish culture" is "indigenous to the land"?

Talmud? Babylon.
Liturgy? Rome.
Mysticism? Medieval Europe.
Bagels? New York.

Only genocide has roots in Judea. https://t.co/iUNctj5Pzc There is literally an entire separate version of the Talmud compiled in Jerusalem that is considered apocryphal wherever it disagrees with Talmud Bavli. This is the entire foundation of Rabbinic Judaism, and it is completely divorced from "Israel."
