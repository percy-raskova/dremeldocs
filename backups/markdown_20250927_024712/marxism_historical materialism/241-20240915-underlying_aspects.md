# underlying aspects

Marxism is, in fact, incompatible with the notion of underlying aspects of reality that cannot be fully captured or computed by a purely physicalist paradigm.

That is, the only aspects of reality we can incorporate into our model of reality are those rooted in the material. https://t.co/j7qMiv2I75 Marxism is scientific. Our theories are built exclusively on empirically demonstrable phenomena, which is critical to the universal nature of our ideology. Spirituality asserts an esoteric aspect to nature; knowledge that can ONLY be received from someone with that knowledge. The distinction between materialism and spiritualism is that the former presents a model of reality that is accessible to *everyone*, actionable, and can always be recapitulated. Marxism belongs to everyone. Spiritual beliefs are exclusionary. You can be a Marxist and personally hold spiritual beliefs, as long as those beliefs aren't regressive, like "passively suffering through your oppression is good for your soul," or "women ought to be subservient to men." But your spiritual beliefs are not themselves Marxist. (It's also very silly to present a pro-spirituality position as being something that will get you chained up and booed when that's the position the majority of people hold, even "leftists.")
