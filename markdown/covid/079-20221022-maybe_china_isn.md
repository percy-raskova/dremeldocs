# Maybe China isn

Zero COVID almost single-handedly made me switch from "Maybe China isn't as awful as western media claims" to "China is a force for global justice."

As bad as the pandemic has been AND STILL IS, it would be much, much worse with 1.4 billion additional viral petri dishes. There is no amount of propaganda that could make me overlook the way China has saved millions of its own citizens, and an untold number of people around the world. If the West had followed their blueprint, this pandemic would be long since over.
