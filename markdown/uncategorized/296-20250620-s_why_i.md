# s why I

@SxLongshadow Yes, that's why I'm a big advocate for "dump a bunch of stuff in a pot" style cooking. Chili for example. Unless your disability is VERY high impact (can't open a couple of cans of beans), in which case you almost certainly need to rely on a caretaker who can cook for you anyway. @SxLongshadow I have actually seen a couple of cooking channels that specifically focus on cooking with disabilities, and they're fantastic! Obviously there's no one method that works for EVERYONE, but it is lovely to see cooking being made as accessible as possible.
