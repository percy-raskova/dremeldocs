# Al-Aqsa Flood

I've been posting about Palestine nonstop since Al-Aqsa Flood began, instead of my usual mix of COVID, climate, queer theory, etc.

It's because this is critical. The ongoing genocide is more than a humanitarian crisis for Palestinians alone: it is a front in a global class war. The battlefields of this war have been slowly emerging over the past several decades, shaped by the imperial ambitions of cartelized western capital, the inexorable onset of climate change, the rise of China, and of course, national liberation struggles across the global south. No single issue can be viewed in isolation. Only the complete landscape of global, interconnected struggles can give us a picture of what the future holds, and how we can shape it. You can be sure the imperial powers are carefully tracking all of it, and planning accordingly. I might have to write a full analysis of these battlefields. I know I keep saying I'll write, and I keep losing steam. But this is really important. Good, honest, passionate people are confused, scared, and hopeless. We need to refocus.
