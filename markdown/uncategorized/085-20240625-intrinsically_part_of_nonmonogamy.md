# intrinsically part of nonmonogamy

@LMillzEsq Why do you seeing cheating on a partner as any more "intrinsically part of nonmonogamy" than any of those forms of abuse being "intrinsically part of monogamy"? @LMillzEsq You seem to be imagining the following situation:

- Two people are in a monogamous relationship
- One of them cheats on the other
- Therefore, the cheater is being "unethically nonmonogamous."

That is not a non-monogamous relationship. That is a failure of monogamy.
