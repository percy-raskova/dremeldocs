# Currently playtesting my newest game

Currently playtesting my newest game. It's called Flesh Machine Divine, and it has the same rules as Rock Paper Scissors, but with extra ennui. The machine subsumes the flesh, the divine scours the machine, the flesh corrupts the divine. An exercise in futility. You must kill the metaphysical to survive.
