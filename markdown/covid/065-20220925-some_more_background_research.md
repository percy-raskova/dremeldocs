# some more background research

@fitterhappierAJ I'm still doing some more background research, but this part seems significant. ADE was not observed in ACE2-negative cells.

Could mean that ADE would affect disease *progression* in certain hosts, but not *transmission*, since ACE2 is negligible in the respiratory system. https://t.co/1euY3FacDU @fitterhappierAJ Whether outdated vaccines exacerbate the disease or are simply less protective, it is still crucial to update them to match new strains. It is genocidally stupid that we've been relying on an obsolete vaccine this whole time, and are just now slowly rolling out an update.
