# anti-queer violence

In 2022, "Israel" had 3,309 reported incidents of anti-queer violence, in a population of 9.4 million.

The US had 11,600 reported incidents in a population of 332 million.

https://t.co/LTZzm2DeFb That's a TENFOLD difference in the rate of violence. And that's only *reported* cases. There's no accounting for the untold number of incidents that never get reported, due to self-blame, social pressure, and clear-eyed recognition of the antipathy by "official" systems. Contrary to the narrative they try to craft, "Israel" is not some gleaming island of progressive values among a dark desert of barbarity. "The West" doesn't give a shit about queer people, or any other oppressed group. Fascist violence is accelerating as the empire falters.
