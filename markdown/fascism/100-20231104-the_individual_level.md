# the individual level

@mo_journeys On the individual level, it's opportunism. However, I do think there's something more going on at the level of the ideological camp as a whole. It meshes pretty seamlessly with a theoretical model of fascism I've been mulling over, about the two competing strains of fascism. @mo_journeys I'll have to write up a full treatise on this at some point, but the basic thesis is that Republicans are part of the Revanchist strain, while Democrats are part of the Supranational strain. Where these strains come down on various issues is determined by their orientation. @mo_journeys Israel is a unique case study in where these interests can diverge. On one hand, it has been oriented as a shining example of revanchist, ethnonationalist hegemony. On the other, it is propped up as a bulwark of the US-EU supranational order that revanchists seek to crack. @mo_journeys And what we're seeing now is discord being sown within the ranks of the revanchists over whether to split with Israel, or whether it is still useful to them. We'll have to see whether these "opportunists" win the day.
