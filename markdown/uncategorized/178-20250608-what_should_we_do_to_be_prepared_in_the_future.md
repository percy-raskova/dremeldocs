# what should we do to be prepared in the future

Among the many possible answers to the question of "what should we do to be prepared in the future?" I think it's especially important to eventually establish:

1. An intelligence network that can get out ahead of ICE raids and identity targets. 2. A network of safe houses to which these targets can be quickly moved beforehand
3. In the worst case scenario, a rapid response team that is able to effectively harry and delay in-progress raids while slipping the targets out and to safety. All of this requires deep roots in the community, both to build those networks and earn the trust of those under threat.

And obviously, the more you are able to enmesh yourself in the community, the more people you will have that are able to be a part of that response.
