# @colinbodayle Ruthless criticism

@colinbodayle Ruthless criticism of all that exists!

...except bourgeois conceptions of the family, the nation, gender, and anything else that comforts me, in particular, as a beneficiary of those social relations. @colinbodayle (Also, I somehow believe that the petty bourgeoisie is more proletarian than the proletariat, which has absolutely nothing to do with my own class position, and I am DEFINITELY NOT an adherent of Mussolini thought. I am just a normal, red-blooded American communist üòå) @colinbodayle ‚òùÔ∏èThis is why I don't even care all that much about the ACP as a concept. It's just a quick little marketing push to recruit their as-yet unorganized fellow petty bourgeois activists before they eventually get folded into the broader fascist movement. They are largely irrelevant.
