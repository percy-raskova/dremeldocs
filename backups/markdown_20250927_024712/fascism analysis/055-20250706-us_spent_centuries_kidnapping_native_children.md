# US spent centuries kidnapping native children , putting...

The US spent centuries kidnapping native children, putting them in boarding schools, and beating them until they stopped speaking their native languages. There are people alive today who went through that. And STILL there are people who think this country is "becoming" fascist ðŸ™„ I only use the past tense because it's no longer as widespread. The government *officially* stopped supporting this practice in 1969, but that doesn't mean it actually ended. I'm honestly not sure how many are still open or how they currently operate, but it's at least  125.
