# A working class liberation movement

A working class liberation movement that is untethered from scientific reality is doomed to fail.

That said, a reading of the scientific reality that does not lead you to support working class liberation is morally abhorrent. "Science" includes social science. It includes feeding social realities into your experimental design and your conclusions.

It includes reckoning with a long history of social biases (racism, sexism, classism, xenophobia) in the construction of our "established" science. Science is a crucial tool for understanding our world, but some of you are clearly NOT understanding our world no matter how much science you do. It's grotesque.

THAT'S why STEM majors need gen ed requirements. Learning how to be human is not a waste of time.
