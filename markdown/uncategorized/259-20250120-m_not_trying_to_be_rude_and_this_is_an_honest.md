# 'm not trying to be rude , and this is an honest question...

I'm not trying to be rude, and this is an honest question for communists in the DSA: what *exactly* is the plan here? Assuming your goal is revolution, how does DSA factor into that?

(I'm assuming that is your goal, otherwise you wouldn't be so attached to the communist label) https://t.co/lbOallSbr3 Obviously you shouldn't lay out some explicit step-by-step plan for building a militarized vanguard on social media. I'm just looking for broad strokes here. How do you get from point A to point B?
