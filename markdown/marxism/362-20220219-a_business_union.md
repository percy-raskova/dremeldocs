# a business union

@BlackRedGuard1 Every baby leftist ought to spend a few years as an organizer for a business union and deal with the twin bullshits of a reactionary working class and non-radical union leadership. If you can't handle that and come out as radical as you entered, you aren't cut out for this work. @BlackRedGuard1 Also, stop using "studying theory" as a synonym for book club. Theory is about formulating an actionable plan for building working class power, and it depends entirely on context.
