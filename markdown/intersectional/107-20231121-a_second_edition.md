# a second edition

@ethan_k_eblg They put out a second edition, updated in 2017 to reflect changing circumstances, over a decade after BDS started.

They've also put out numerous, fully-fleshed out statements since 10/7. They clarified that they *support* boycotts, but have not asked for it as a primary tactic. @ethan_k_eblg And like I said, we should be engaging in boycotts as supplementary to the primary strategy of disrupting the occupation *directly*. And I think any organization getting started should be aiming toward enacting local, targeted boycotts as a metric of organizational strength.
