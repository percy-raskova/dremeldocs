# @GoadGatsby @carterforva Pronouns in Hebrew are usually...

@GoadGatsby @carterforva Pronouns in Hebrew are usually implied by the form of the verb, same as the tense. The tetragrammaton is a verb written in a way that deliberately obscures tense and pronouns to mean "he/it will/has/does exist/existed." @GoadGatsby @carterforva In Judaism, it's forbidden to even try and pronounce יהוה at all, and you just say "Adonai," meaning "my master" (another pronoun-containing word).
