# the healthcare outcomes

@aimee_pohl I'm currently working on a review of a new study looking at the healthcare outcomes of omicron.

While the chance of severe illness from omicron is only ~30% that of the early days of delta, the severity rate between it and *current* delta patients is essentially the same. @aimee_pohl In other words, news of it being "comparatively mild" is misleading. Whether you get Delta or omicron, the chance of it being a severe case is about the same. But you're way more likely to get omicron, even if you're vaccinated.
