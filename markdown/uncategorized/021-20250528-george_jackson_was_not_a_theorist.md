# George Jackson was not a theorist

@KM__Thompson I have seen the same people literally say "George Jackson was not a theorist," a claim that can only possibly make sense if you define "theorist" as "white dude." @KM__Thompson Not even "he wasn't a GOOD theorist." Just... not a theorist. Like it's some sort of medical degree that can only be distributed by an accredited institution.
