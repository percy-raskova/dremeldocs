# enhanced interrogation

Imagine instead of spending two hours getting jostled around, waiting in line, being patted and prodded and scanned by security before then cramming into a cattle car where you spend the next two hours in the stress position they use for "enhanced interrogation"... https://t.co/r89qnsKtBN ... then arriving on a plume of greenhouse gasses heavier than all the people on the flight combined, spending another hour disembarking and retrieving your luggage and FINALLY escaping...

Imagine instead of that, you could hop on a train, stretch out, take a nap, then hop off.
