# t understand why I would cut her off over a 

Haha, my mother apparently said she didn't understand why I would cut her off over a "difference of opinion," especially considering how our opinions can't affect a conflict half a world away.

To which the answer is "Why wouldn't YOU drop your support of Zionism?" If it's so irrelevant, it should be easy. As of this moment, my family are the ones deciding that I'm less important to them than the abstract concept of a theocratic ethnostate.

But it's NOT irrelevant. To either of us. This "difference" is one of central, guiding principles.
