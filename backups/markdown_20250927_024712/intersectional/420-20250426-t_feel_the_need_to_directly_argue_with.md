# t feel the need to directly argue with trotskyists over...

I honestly don't feel the need to directly argue with trotskyists over basic history, but no, the US revolution was not "progressive," and it's certainly not something to appeal to. We are communists. We do not reproduce the bourgeois mythos of the empire we seek to destroy. https://t.co/5TGfAZf46h "But Lenin said--"

Are you communists? Or are you religious acolytes, mindlessly reciting context less verses from unassailable prophets? Nothing Lenin said was true simply by the fact that he said it: it is YOUR responsibility to defend your position.
