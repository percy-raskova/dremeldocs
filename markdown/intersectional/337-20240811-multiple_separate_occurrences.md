# multiple separate occurrences

It's unclear what event this is referring to, since it seems to conflate multiple separate occurrences. The closest I can think of is the Kornilov Affair, which was not "the Kadet party gaining power" in the sense of elections, but an outright armed coup attempt. https://t.co/IOktXwJaQ5 The coup was led by Lavr Kornilov, whom Kerensky himself had recently appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian army. Kornilov, along with the military officers who supported him, were motivated by a desire to crush both the Petrograd Soviet and the Bolsheviks. The Soviet was much more powerful and influential within the city than the provisional government. They organized the armed defense of the city against the forces of Kornilov. It was Kerensky who allied with *them* out of self-preservation, not the other way around. Several Bolshevik leaders, who had been arrested since the July Days, were released to help with the defense of the city. The Soviet and the Bolsheviks were armed and ready, to meet the imminent violence. Bolsheviks conducted sabotage efforts to deter Kornilov's advance. At no point in this chapter of revolutionary did Lenin or any other Bolshevik say "Alright gents, time for us to swallow our pride and vote for the lesser of two evils!"

Instead, Kerensky crawled on his knees, begging them to defend him against the threat he had helped create. So unless your proposed "temporary alliance" involves us, as communists, already holding equal or greater power to that of the government, and the Democrats freeing and arming us to meet impending fascist violence with our own violent resistance, the comparison has no relevance.
