# @Soylent_Spring Thank you for sharing

@Soylent_Spring Thank you for sharing. This is exactly how I feel about so many people in my life right now. Their lack of care is not just "high risk tolerance": it is an indication that they think I'm irrational, hysterical, overly anxious. It's not a foundation for mutual respect or trust. @Soylent_Spring They don't even have the excuse of ignorance.  I have spent the entire pandemic sharing the science with friends and family as it developed, culminating in writing a comprehensive, well-received, easy-to-understand review, replete with citations.
