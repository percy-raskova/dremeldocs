# @AbbyMachines I have a comrade who has been arguing with...

@AbbyMachines I have a comrade who has been arguing with DSA people about the way they protect Zionists instead of kicking them out. He said "If they were spewing Nazi talking points, would we not kick them out??"

The answer? "Oh, that would be up to the 'grievance process' to handle." @AbbyMachines "We can't spend all of our time as an organization adjudicating purity tests."

YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T SPEND ALL OF YOUR TIME AS AN ORGANIZATION MAKING SURE YOU'RE AN ORGANIZATION?
