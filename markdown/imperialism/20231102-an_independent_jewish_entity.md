# an independent, Jewish entity

There has never been an independent, Jewish entity that ruled over the entirety of the region claimed by Zionists as "Israel." The closest was ~50 years of the Hasmonean dynasty, which never extended south of Beersheba, between the suzerainty of the Seleucid and Roman empires. https://t.co/D3tPc1FHYp If we want to be VERY generous with our definitions, there was a small, centrally-organized Hebrew polity -- the Kingdom of Judah -- extending between Jerusalem and Beersheba, that was largely independent for about 2 centuries, before being subsumed into Neo-Assyria. For those keeping score, there was a maximum of about 250 years of an independent Jewish state in Palestine over the past 3,000 years, most of which covered only a tiny portion of the region, none of which covered all of it, and none of which was in the past 2,000 years.
