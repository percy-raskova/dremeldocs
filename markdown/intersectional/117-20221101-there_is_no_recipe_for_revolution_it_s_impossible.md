THERE IS NO RECIPE FOR REVOLUTION

It's impossible to predict how a revolution will go. It's impossible to follow a set of instructions and be assured of victory. It's impossible to know how to perfectly run a new society and protect it from global capital. This is *especially* true in the imperial core. There has never been a successful revolution here--no major socialist experiments to build on, no theoretical guides. Our job is to ADAPT our global socialist heritage. Experiment. To use what worked there in a form that works here. How do we even start? What repression will we face and how do we overcome it? How do we return imperial wealth to those from whom it was stolen? How do we build a better life for the working class here? How do we pin down global capital and eradicate it? We can't simply imagine the end goal and meditate it into being. We can't simply copy-paste the tactics used in a different world. And crucially, we can't just wait until we have a "perfect plan" and "perfect conditions." There is no such thing. We have to begin building NOW. Build cadres NOW. Build mass orgs NOW. Build militias NOW.

Start a plan to build, start building, use what you build to refine and expand your plan. This IS the scientific method. We don't need more theories: we need more experiments. We need more hands.

We need a party.
