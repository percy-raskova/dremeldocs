# s funny how it

It's funny how it's literally always my fault. And when I apologize, I habitually explain why I did the thing that made someone upset. But they don't want an explanation, they want subservience. So I apologize for my apology. But THAT apology never counts. I already fucked it up. Somehow, I'm never the one who deserves grace: I just have to keep apologizing, until it is magically resolved. Except if I do that, I'm a manipulator, trying to TRICK people into liking me. My feelings have ALWAYS come second -- or not at all -- as it has been my entire life. I think the only way to actually heal from a lifetime of trauma and gaslighting is to just accept that I don't actually need the acceptance of people who only want to be mad at me. It's not my responsibility to "earn" people tolerating me.
