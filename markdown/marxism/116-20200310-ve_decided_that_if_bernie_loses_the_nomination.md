# ve decided that if Bernie loses the nomination (meaning...

I've decided that if Bernie loses the nomination (meaning Biden inevitably loses to Trump) I'll just recontextualize it as a good thing by becoming an accerelationist. I'll be pissed, of course, that another 60k people will die every year from not being able to see a doctor, and that the climate apocalypse will be ensured. But at least a lot of other people will be pissed too. Maybe they'll be pissed enough to actually break from the system. The Democratic establishment willfully enabling Trump part 2 could radicalize enough people that we could actually form a nationally-viable third party. In 2024, we could launch a presidential candidate that picks up enough steam to completely overshadow those paltry third party attempts of the past, like Green and Libertarian candidates, often perceived as spoilers. The strategy should be to focus the campaign on specific states with large independent electorates: places like Colorado and Iowa, where registered independents outnumber both parties, and swing states like PA, where even registered Dems and Repubs are more swayable by populism. We don't compete in California, Maryland, Alabama, where the establishment is powerful. We pour all of our resources into a few states that we could realistically win as a third party. And then we win. We win even a single state to prove our point. We get electoral votes and get on the map. If we do it right, we prevent either party from getting to 270. If this happens, the US House chooses the president, with each state getting one vote. This would probably advantage the Republican candidate. We'd lose another election. But as should be obvious by now, if an establishment Democrat wins, there is no material difference from a Republican. This is a party that would veto Medicare for All if it passed both houses. From there, this new third party would start winning the culture war. We'd have a chance at real, material gains for the working class. We'll suffer in the interim. But we'll suffer anyway. We've been suffering for centuries. This is a really hard calculation to make. I'm not going to be among those hurt the most by abdicating the miniscule gains we could feebly hope for under a Democratic admin. I'd be hurt, sure, but not by as much as some. But all of that pales against the cruelty of the status quo All of this could be avoided if Bernie wins. I'm still fighting. I won't give up until victory is impossible. But it's time to be real. Pair this strategy with down ballot races in the states we're actually going for, and we can actually win some seats for a third party. That will allow us national attention that could be leveraged for more competitive appeal in future cycles.
