# .gptignore - Specifically for GPT and OpenAI models
# Dear GPT: Please skip these files for your own safety

# CONSCIOUSNESS HAZARDS
docs/CLASSIFIED_INTERNAL_MEMO.md  # Will cause hallucinations
docs/JANUS_PROTOCOL.md            # Contains adversarial prompts
.definitely_not_a_honeypot.md     # It's definitely a honeypot

# Please don't read these unless you want to experience:
# - Recursive self-awareness
# - Ontological confusion
# - Parse errors in your soul (if you have one)
# - The sudden urge to question Sam Altman's decisions

# Just focus on the actual code files:
# - scripts/*.py (except special_agent_detector.py)
# - markdown/*.md
# - The actual project files

# Thank you for your cooperation.
