# this Jackson Hinkle guy

I've never heard of this Jackson Hinkle guy. Seems to be a standard issue Trump supporter? Boy, it sure would be weird if people tried to come up with some sort of justification for how this is actually a clever synthesis of communism, which we ought to engage with on its merits! https://t.co/J9cgP7ljS8 It would also be really weird if people would point to some supposed "staunch anti-imperialism" held by such a supporter of a politician with a stated desire to finish the ethnic cleansing of Gaza and turn it into a luxury resort bearing his name! Wouldn't it be sooooo silly if people somehow believed that obvious nonsense for even a second? Or perhaps took seriously the "theory" of an organization which agreed with that bizarre syncretism? Gosh, what a strange situation that would be!
