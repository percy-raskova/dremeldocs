# a core capitalist project

@jasonhickel The punchy way to say it is that the climate crisis is a core capitalist project, and can never be solved under the system that benefits by it. Capitalism rewards the most exploitative, extractive, and destructive practices, which make commodity production the most profitable. @jasonhickel If a capitalist can save a dollar by destroying the environment, that's an extra dollar he can use to push more "ethical" capitalists out of the market. The iteration of this simple event drives the development of the market. Biosphere collapse is the highest stage of capitalism. @jasonhickel It can't be reformed or regulated or negotiated into compliance. If you retain the property relations, you retain the profit motive. Any remaining trickle of profit represents social power capital will always use to restore itself to its full, destructive, world-eating form.
