# the dying stage

@primarycatdad I would argue that eclecticism not just characteristic of the dying stage of liberalism, but rather one of its defining features since the beginning. It's why it was able to so effectively supercede and subsume the more necessarily-fractious political strains. @primarycatdad Liberalism is now dying *because* of that same eclectic nature, because that vaguely-defined coalition is falling apart. The hegemonic structure originally crafted by blood is now held together with vibes. Imperialism isn't strong enough to patch the ideological holes.
