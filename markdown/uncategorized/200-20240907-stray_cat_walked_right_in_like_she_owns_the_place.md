# Stray cat walked right in like she owns the place and made...

Stray cat walked right in like she owns the place and made herself at home.

Like. Alright. Guess I have a cat now? ðŸ¤¨ https://t.co/CruupFsAks I met a woman who feeds all the local strays, taking over from this older lady who is laid up from a bad fall ðŸ˜”

The local cats all get scooped and spayed/neutered by a qualified neighbor who does it for free. They've also gotten flea baths, and get fed regularly. Sorry I skipped the alt text in my excitement. Pictured above is the tiniest, sweetest, loveliest grey kitty. Nuzzling my leg, nuzzling my shoe rack, wandering a hallway, dipping her paw in water and licking it.
