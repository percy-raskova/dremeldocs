# supposed loved ones

@STLMasking I miss feeling like I'm not disposable to supposed loved ones, who would rather go to restaurants than allow me to still have a safe social bubble. And that's something I will never get back, even if COVID disappeared ðŸ˜” @STLMasking Yes, you're 100% right that the little things like restaurants are not the extent of what has been lost. But now, I've lost ALL social contact, because the people who were supposed to be there for me couldn't bear losing SOME social contact.
