Legitimately got so mad at this I just dissociated for a minute.

Your "trauma" is that you had to stay inside for a few months four years ago.

My trauma has been ongoing, that entire time: a chronic condition, constantly learning how much WORSE this is than we thought... https://t.co/UBOiZYmWhm ... and gaslighting at every level of society, from medical "professionals," to government agencies, to "woe is me" liberals like you, all regimented into the same synchronous march of perfect callousness and ignorance to reproduce that same deadly culture of death cult nihilism. This "the cure is worse than the disease" attitude has ravaged every corner of public health, degrading a system already predicated on eugenics and social control from one which nevertheless handed out sporadic and meager relief into an unvarnished tool of destruction. We have FUCKING MEASLES running rampant in places where it had been driven out. Tuberculosis. Candida.

You are not "traumatized," you just believe you are entitled to an ill-gotten "normal." One which has been barbarously plundered from those you would sooner never think about. Billions have NEVER known your normal, while you believe it is yours by divine right. The moment you caught a mere glimpse of a break in that normal, it was such a "trauma" that, rather than let it shape you into a force for justice, you decided to confine it to that one moment. You let it twist you into a shadow of a human. You dare not speak the name of the villain that reminded you so briefly that you are not owed the world. You refuse to see it when it stands in front of you. Yet, here it stands -- not a memo in a calendar, but a virus:

SARS-CoV-2.
