# @lovecrashdown I was about to say, I'm mainly talking about...

@lovecrashdown I was about to say, I'm mainly talking about bit characters introduced and thrown away for a quick laugh. Hence "visibility" in quotes. Not any examples I would *want* to cite. @lovecrashdown I'm also mainly talking about the 90s/00s, which in my estimation was an especially heinous era. Queer people were no longer simply invisibilized -- we became visible caricatures and objects of ridicule.
