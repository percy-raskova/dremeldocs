# ve been tinkering with since I was a teenager could be...

@RodericDay A story I've been tinkering with since I was a teenager could be qualified as "gray morality" epic opposed to fascism. The "grayness" of the morality is purposefully illustrative of the reflexive intolerance of revolution by even "decent" people who "want change." @RodericDay That is, from the perspective of a revolutionary, it's not really gray, although the protagonists certainly make iffy choices due to inexperience. But the main protagonist constantly battles the internalized feelings that they are the "villain."
