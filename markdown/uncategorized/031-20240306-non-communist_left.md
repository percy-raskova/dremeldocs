# non-communist left

@m1vql1hdwt I agree with the point on amicability with the nationalism of oppressed nations, but I sincerely do not trust in any way the "non-communist left," and have no idea how we're supposed to have good working relationships with those who clearly despise us on an ideological level. @m1vql1hdwt I don't know, maybe I've just been burned too many times and am not seeing things "objectively." I'm sure there are specific controlled avenues for alliance -- until such time as they have to make their choice between us and the oppressors.
