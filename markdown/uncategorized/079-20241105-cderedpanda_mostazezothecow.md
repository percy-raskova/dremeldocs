# @cderedpanda @mostazezothecow

@cderedpanda @mostazezothecow It's starting to dawn on me that the "sex work is work" crowd seems to believe the playground myth that men can literally die of blue balls, and that masturbation doesn't work, and therefore, if no one willingly has sex with them, they need some other outlet (i.e. coercion). @cderedpanda @mostazezothecow Like, I can think of no other explanation for it being described as "beneficial."
