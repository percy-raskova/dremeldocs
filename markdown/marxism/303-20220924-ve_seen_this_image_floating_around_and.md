# 've seen this image floating around , and

I've seen this image floating around, and yeah, it looks like a cute little thing about how ~~quirky~~ Judaism is.

But there's also a frightening message contained within it, which tacitly supports Israeli apartheid. https://t.co/AbCbOxOUga These four events are not "Jewish holidays." They are Israeli national holidays with no religious backing to them at all. They were explicitly created as part of the colonial project. And here, they are being presented as just another part of the Jewish experience. https://t.co/15TPWOs07G Yom HaAliyah is a day celebrating Jews who "make aliyah," i.e. immigrate to Israel to "strengthen the Jewish nation" by holding land. Aliyah is taught to Jews abroad as a core Jewish value.

Yom HaZikaron is a remembrance of all the Jewish soldiers lost in the wars of occupation. Yom HaAtzma'ut is "independence day," celebrating the 1948 war. To Palestinians, this is commemorated as Nakba Day, the day of the destruction of Palestinian society.

Yom Yerushalayim is a celebration of the annexation of East Jerusalem and occupation of the West Bank in 1967. Notice how all of these events are listed as "They tried to kill us."

Invasion, destruction, occupation, displacement, and apartheid are put on equal footing with Yom HaShoah, the commemoration of the Holocaust. This is a crucial part of the founding myth of Israel. The colonial project is sold to the Jewish people and the world as a "justified" response to the "oppression" of non-Jews existing in the "Jewish homeland." People defending the homes they've held for centuries is being presented as a form of genocide. Jews have a long history of being oppressed, displaced, and exterminated en masse. We don't need to invent new oppressions, and we certainly don't need to repay that historical oppression with our own oppressive regime.

Zionism is not Judaism.
