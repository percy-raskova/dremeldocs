# their shattered bodies

Capitalism achieved these things by slaughtering and enslaving the populations of 5 continents, crystallizing the surplus extracted from their shattered bodies into advanced means of production, and transforming itself into the most potent factory of suffering in human history. https://t.co/Q123VJ3qLY Throughout the centuries of the expansion of bourgeois hegemony, the oppressed peoples of the world have seen none of the supposed benefits of the capitalist system over feudalism. In every land the capitalists touched, conditions sharply declined. Life expectancy, nutritional sufficiency, availability of clean water, soil quality, and biodiversity plummeted, while disease, war, inequality, extreme poverty, and starvation skyrocketed. British India saw a constant decline in life expectancy until the British left. To this day, the ravages of colonial rule are still present and held in place by all the latest innovations in imperial technology. Any attempt to escape the shackles of so-called "neo"colonialism are met with sanctions, invasions, coups, and mass devastation and death. And still we have barely begun to scratch the surface of the apocalyptic reality of climate change, the direct offspring of capitalist production, one whose ravages are felt already, while it is still in its infancy. Ravages which, again, are visited largely on the global south. Any comparison between capitalism and feudalism is nonsensical from the premise. What good is the advancement of the means of production if the gains are hoarded behind the walls of empire, and the toxic sludge it produces is pumped out into the world's rivers? Capitalism can only be called a "net positive" once that mountain of congealed surplus is finally liberated from the dam that holds it back, and can be used to uplift the people from whose blood it was harvested.

At which point, it will no longer be capitalism.
