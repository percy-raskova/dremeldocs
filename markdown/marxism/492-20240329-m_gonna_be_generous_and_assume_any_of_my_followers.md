# m gonna be generous and assume any of my followers...

I'm gonna be generous and assume any of my followers following this account are doing so for fedwatching purposes, because this shit goes beyond "misguided." It's the equivalent of a "communist" claiming "media and government" are using fear of climate change to control us. https://t.co/HUcb3hUryQ Here's the actual way capitalists manipulated you on COVID. They DID use fear to control you: by persuading you it's over, that it was no big deal, that you should not believe your lying eyes as you watch the ongoing decline in public health.
