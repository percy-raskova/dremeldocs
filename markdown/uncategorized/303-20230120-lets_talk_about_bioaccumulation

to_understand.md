Let's talk about bioaccumulation!

To understand this, you need to know about trophic levels:

At the base level of every ecosystem live the Producers, which produce all the food molecules, using an energy source like the sun. The most common producers are plants. https://t.co/DP3sMh4Nhe The things that eat producers are called Primary Consumers. These organisms get all of their energy from those same food molecules made by producers.

Secondary Consumers get energy by eating primary consumers (and possibly also producers), and so on. Over the course of an animal's life, it has to eat WAY more biomass from the trophic levels below than the amount of biomass it creates for itself. How many pounds of food do you imagine you've eaten in your life? Probably around 10 times your weight every year alone. This means that any contaminants that stick around in the body tend to *accumulate* as you go up the trophic layers. If plants suck up 1 unit per pound of a contaminant in the water, the primary consumers will have 10 units per pound, secondary consumers will have 100/pound, etc. That's why seafood at the top of the food chain (like swordfish) presents a high risk of mercury poisoning, while salmon is fine. The krill that salmon eat have infinitesimal amounts of mercury in them, while the things that eat the things that eat salmon have &gt;1,000x as much. So even "low" amounts of contamination in the base of an ecosystem, such as in the water, can be critically toxic by the time humans eat the things that eat the things that eat the things that eat contaminated plants, as long as those contaminants stick around in those organisms. Normally, these ecosystems are full of organisms that have evolved to deal with whatever chemicals there are in the environment. They metabolize, sequester, excrete, and otherwise eliminate unnecessary molecules before they can reach dangerous concentrations. But when humans introduce a foreign substance through pollution, the organisms might not have evolved any biological methods for getting it *out* of the food chain. That's how we end up with fish that are "equivalent to a month of contaminated water."
