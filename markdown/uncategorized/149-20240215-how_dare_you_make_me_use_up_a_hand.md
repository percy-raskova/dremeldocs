# How dare you make me use up a hand

"How dare you make me use up a hand" has got to be a pastiche.

If you don't feel like talking... don't pick up??

(That said, a customary "Hey, wanna talk?" text is considered good form.) https://t.co/orF08U1Zvs I say this as someone who used to HATE the idea of talking on the phone. And then I met people who preferred it, and I humored them. And you know what? It's nice!
