# @bmore_radical I am not as confident about the course of...

@bmore_radical I am not as confident about the course of omicron anymore, because it's now spiralling faster than I expected. I naively assumed, for example, there would be at least *some* meager delay in in-person school. We'll definitely peak before March as omicron runs out of new hosts. @bmore_radical But a *dip* doesn't mean it will be gone, and there's still tons of room for it to spread, mutate, reinfect, etc. There's no telling yet when/if we'll see a new variant that can evade omicron immunity in the way that omicron evades delta/prior immunity while staying infectious.
