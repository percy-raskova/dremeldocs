# topical vitamin c

@swishyism There's no evidence that topical vitamin c can even penetrate into the dermis, let alone a clinical outcome. Beauty products are notorious for unsubstantiated claims, backed by "clinical trials" relying on subjective surveys ("How do you *feel* about whether or not this worked?") @swishyism I'm not saying there's NO WAY it works, just that it's a spurious claim made by companies with an interest in stringing people along by taking advantage of their insecurities.
