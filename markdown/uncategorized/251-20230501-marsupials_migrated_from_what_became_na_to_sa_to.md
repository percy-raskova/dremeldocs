# Marsupials migrated from what became NA to SA to Antarctica...

@Rocko64_ Marsupials migrated from what became NA to SA to Antarctica to Aus. Marsupials and placental mammals diverged over 100 million years ago, when Pangaea had already started to break apart. But South America, Antarctica, and Australia stayed together for quite a long time. @Rocko64_ Most marsupials got outcompeted by placentals in the Americas, but placentals never really made it in Australia, other than some bats and rodents. And obviously, once Antarctica made it to the pole, it became pretty difficult for marsupials to survive.
