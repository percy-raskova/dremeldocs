# @ParacelsusII Standpoint epistemology

@ParacelsusII Standpoint epistemology is just liberalism's facile attempt to combat the liberatory power of material analysis. It doesn't even hold up to the slightest scrutiny, such as the obvious fact that individuals within a given group can hold wildly different perspectives. @ParacelsusII It gets pretty blatant when you see *which* voices get amplified within capitalist hegemony -- those that call for "decorum," assimilation, nonviolence, anything *except* abolishing systems of oppression at their material root.
