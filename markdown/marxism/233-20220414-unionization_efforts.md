# unionization efforts

Hilariously, if capitalists weren't so tied to the cult of constant profit, they would have so many tools for dealing with unionization efforts. The threat of organized labor only works because capitalists can't survive having the work shut down for even a couple of weeks. And the reason for *that* is because of the financialization of our economy. These corporations depend on investment, which depends on the *appearance* of profitability. Pausing operations to starve out unionization efforts would cause investors to head for the hills.
