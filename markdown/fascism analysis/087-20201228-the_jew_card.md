# the Jew card

If I can pull out the Jew card here for a second:

The most anti-semitic thing I can think of is trying to tie my Jewishness to a fascist apartheid nation. Imagining that being Jewish imparts me with an ancestral loyalty to some insidious, vicious, and controlling nationality is some Nazi shit.
