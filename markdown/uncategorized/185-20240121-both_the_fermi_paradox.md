# Both the Fermi paradox

@KirbyHonest Both the Fermi paradox and most of its proposed solutions have, as a premise, the belief that alien life is basically just like human society -- specifically, THIS human society. @KirbyHonest "Bruh, obviously spacefaring aliens would be preoccupied with conquest! They're either conquerors or scared of being conquered."
