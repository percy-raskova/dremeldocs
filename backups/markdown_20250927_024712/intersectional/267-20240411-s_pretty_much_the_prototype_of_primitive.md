@DecolonialMarx It's pretty much the prototype of primitive accumulation*, the capture of EXISTING resources under the banner of capital -- which by definition is not "progression of productive forces." In the same way that people moving from one place to another is not a "population increase." @DecolonialMarx ESPECIALLY if that movement is a perilous journey and much of the existing population dies -- just because the NEW location has more people does not mean there has been an increase in population. Colonial conquest is exactly the same; immense destruction in the name of *movement*
