# YouTube leftists

Bad Empanada is one of those rare "YouTube leftists" who is infected only with a few liberal particles, not Hitler particles.

We can argue about his relative merits all day, but the bottom line is he should not have been suspended for making a hilarious 9/11 joke. I will say that liberal particles are still radioactive, and will eventually decay into Hitler particles if you don't excise them properly. But in my opinion, anyone who stalwartly supports the Cuban revolution (without painting a false utopia) deserves critical support.
