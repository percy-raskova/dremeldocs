# a Democratic government

If your organizing would be possible under a Democratic government, but impossible under a Republican government, you're organizing wrong.

The only organizing worth doing is the kind that would provoke repression from both and is able to weather repression from either. You could only ever believe it would be "easier to organize under Democrats" if your broadest horizon for "organizing" is begging Democrats for scraps they will never give you anyway, and then being grateful for their empty promises of "Maybe next time, buddy!"
