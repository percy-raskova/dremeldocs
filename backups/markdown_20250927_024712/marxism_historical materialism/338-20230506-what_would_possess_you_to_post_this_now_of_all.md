# What would possess you to post this NOW, of all times

What. What. What.

What would possess you to post this NOW, of all times?

It should be clear to anyone paying attention that Jacobin is not simply composed of undeveloped liberals lacking a real politics of liberation. Their primary purpose is to swindle, divert, and malign. https://t.co/C6Xv3NiZyz Would I go so far as to proclaim them "plants," paid by capitalists to sow discord and convince the masses that socialism is fundamentally antagonistic to liberation? No, not without evidence, I wouldn't.

They're probably dumber than that: they're doing that work FOR FREE.
