# do not want Trump to be reelected 

I do not want Trump to be reelected. No honest leftist does.

But I'm not going to waste my energy on GOTV for Joe.

If only the DNC hadn't just spent a year proving to us that our relentless efforts mean nothing, this might be a different scenario. They may think they don't need to work to secure the votes of the hardcore Bernie supporters. They probably think (with good reason), that enough of us will fall in line behind the lesser of two evils that the rest can be ignored. But it's not our votes you need. It's our energy. Bernie had an army of 1,000,000 unpaid, volunteer organizers, putting in a combined $200 million worth of work in a *primary*. If they had coronated Bernie instead of Biden, this thing would have been wrapped up by Super Tuesday, and the army would have been unleashed on Trump. Instead, they put all their effort into quashing that power, demoralizing the left, and making sure they'd enter a general election with nothing but billionaire money. They could have had a powerful weapon in the war on fascism. But beating Trump was never their real goal.
