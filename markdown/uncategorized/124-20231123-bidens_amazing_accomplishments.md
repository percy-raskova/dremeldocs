# Biden's ~amazing accomplishments~

Starting this list of Biden's ~amazing accomplishments~ with something that simply did not happen has lead me to a distressing conclusion:

Will Stancil has played us all for fools. This entire time, he has been conducting a MASTERFUL campaign of trolling. Unmatched. Unbeaten. https://t.co/ZuZSnLfKwo Admit it: you got got, same as I did. We all uncritically bought into the carefully crafted persona of "smug liberal douche who legitimately believes his own bullshit." I would say I'm ashamed, but there's no shame in losing to the best.
