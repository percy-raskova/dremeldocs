# mainstream science

@DcrInYYC Depends what you mean by "mainstream science." Within a class society, the institutions that moderate who gets to be a scientist, what science gets funded, how scientific findings are promulgated, etc. are themselves moderated by class relations. @DcrInYYC The more fascist a society becomes, the more the "mainstream" of that society reflects fascist values, including science. Expect any real science that flies in the face of fascism to be pushed out of the mainstream in increasingly violent ways.
