# the violence arm

The police are the violence arm of the power structure. Their only job? Meet disobedience with force.

Individual cops often have no idea of their real purpose. The ones who revel in the facile power they're awarded use their authorized violence freely, hence the murder. In their minds, disobedience to *them* challenges that fake power. That's a threat to their social position, which is tenuous by design.

Combine this with the high stress environment the power structure puts them in to maintain their interests, and snapping is inevitable. That covers the majority of police brutality--including victims from all races. The rest is literal white supremacy, which makes plenty of sense: the facile power afforded by a police career attracts the exact kind of people susceptible to supremacist thought. Boy, I wish tweets were longer. It's hard to condense the complex sociology and psychology going on without shaving off important nuance. But that's basically all you need to know. Most police violence is not the result of specific bad actors, but an entire web of power relations
