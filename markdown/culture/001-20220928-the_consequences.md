# the consequences

@primarycatdad One of the consequences of just-in-time is that food *does* rot on the ground. Giant agricultural corporations deliberately grow much more food than they can deliver in this razor-thin distribution model to account for various factors (breakage, unappealing produce, poor harvest) @primarycatdad So a huge chunk of the food grown isn't even harvested. It literally withers on the vine because it can't produce marginal profit.

... but that's probably a story for another article. ðŸ¤”
