# most radical lefties

Some of the "most radical lefties" you knew in your mid-twenties were never radical at all, and were simply petit-bourgeois kids who liked the aesthetic of challenging social norms without doing anything to attack the economic conditions that have buoyed them their entire lives. https://t.co/V5vFhrqB0j Partially true: theory alone is insufficient to engender a revolutionary spirit. But neither is a vague "caring about other people." Class instincts and the material privileges of imperialist extraction easily filter perceptions of acceptable empathy. https://t.co/1ByA8qxFOu
