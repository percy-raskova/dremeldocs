# 'm working on writing a fairy tale called The Normal , set...

I'm working on writing a fairy tale called The Normal, set in a world where the entire society is structured around feeding a monster who appears to be just an average man, except he never speaks or even stops eating. They call both the man and the act of serving him The Normal. They all think it's just... the way things are. They spend all their time working to prepare and bring him food. When they reach the front of the line to give him their offering, little fairies flit about grabbing little bits of food spilling from his mouth and giving it to them. It'll be like an inverse fairy tale, where instead of the young heroine being let in on a world of magic, she is shown reality by a scientist who shatters the fairy-magic illusion of any of this being natural or acceptable. The Normal is revealed: not a man, but a ravenous beast.
