# more amateur revolutionary military science

Follow me for more amateur revolutionary military science, informed by a bunch of reading and absolutely NO on-the-ground experience whatsoever lol ðŸ¤­ But in all seriousness, that's literally the point of SCIENCE. You share your results with others, to inform their theory, so they can begin building their own practice without needing to start from square one. We don't need to experiment randomly: we have precedent to draw on. Refusing to study and plan before acting, because that's "book worship," is an abandonment of our revolutionary heritage, and a betrayal of those who fought and sacrificed for our right to those experimental results. LEARN FROM THEIR WORK.
