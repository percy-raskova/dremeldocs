# all regressive social forces

Communism stands opposed to all regressive social forces. Religion *in general* acts as a sort of "social friction," opposing movement away from where society already sits.

However, what we choose to focus our ire on depends on the position various social fractions are in. https://t.co/lfs5Xof6Zu In western society, Christianity is hegemonic. In Israel, Judaism is hegemonic. This means that the material impact of "religion as oppositional force" is significant when applied to those religions -- they are used as part of the toolkit of empire. Communists don't "love Islam." Islam *also* acts as a conservative force in places and subpopulations where *it* is the one that's hegemonic. It's just that that's not the case in the context of western imperialism -- i.e. the context of the *entire west-dominated global system.* Right now, people are fighting for liberation, and many of them happen to be Muslim. The cause is not specifically an Islamic one: the resistance has numerous secularists -- including secular Marxists -- among its ranks. But the population in question IS majority-Muslim. Some of them *specifically* draw on their religion as a source of inspiration while under the yoke of oppression. Some outside the occupation see it as their duty to assist *because* of their shared faith. Telling them "No! You're motivated INCORRECTLY" would be detestable. We don't support Islam over Judaism or Christianity. This is not a "religious war," in which communists have arbitrarily picked Islam as "the good one." It is a war of national liberation. We oppose oppression and support liberation. It's really that simple.
