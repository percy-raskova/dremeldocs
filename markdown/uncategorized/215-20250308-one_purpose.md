# one purpose

This is an example of exaptation, where a trait that originally evolved for one purpose finds new use in different conditions. One common illustration is bird feathers: originally an adaptation for thermoregulation, the existing trait was able to evolve to give rise to flight. https://t.co/WA2jqhW96o "How could babies have evolved such a complex behavior like car-crashing?" is a similar question to "How could such complex organs like eyes have evolved?"

The answer is that these traits emerge by co-opting existing ancestral traits that already worked for a simpler purpose.
