# The huge investment firms

@JohnHamburger69 The huge investment firms that act as the grand adjudicators have become so successful because of their ability to balance short- and medium-term interests. 10-year projections are very common for valuations on this scale. @JohnHamburger69 For example, energy companies a decade ago made a bet that they could transition some of their capital to renewables, based on an optimistic prediction of the rate of profit being able to exceed fossil fuels. They recently reevaluated, and divested in the face of 4-8% margins. @JohnHamburger69 And yes, this means our planet is burning because capitalists would simply rather make 15-20% profit, rather than 5-10%.
