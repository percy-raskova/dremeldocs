# hardened and radicalized liberals

I know the phrase "hardened and radicalized liberals" sounds silly (the original post was likely a "joke" by a "comedian"). But that is actually what happened. A "radicalized liberal" is literally just a fascist. Trump is not a cause of this radicalization, but a symptom of it. https://t.co/BOGzgbopNN (More accurately, he is both cause and effect. Society works in dialectical loops, with multiple inputs and outputs, cumulative effects, and multifarious operating conditions.)
