# private, profit-motivated entities

Internet, gas, electricity, water, phones, transit, healthcare, education etc. are the fuel our society needs to run.

They cannot be controlled by private, profit-motivated entities. There should be no possible way for these vital services to be denied to anyone. https://t.co/2gjKoOnohR Correction: gas itself isn't inherently vital, just the ability to heat your home and cook your food. This can be accomplished with clean energy, not just gas.
