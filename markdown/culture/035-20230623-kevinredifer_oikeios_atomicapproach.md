# @kevinredifer @oikeios @atomicapproach

@kevinredifer @oikeios @atomicapproach @BizarrelyCoca The U.S. is "energy independent" BECAUSE of the very same military hegemony we were talking about in the first place! It controls most of the world's fossil fuel reserves, either directly or through big stick diplomacy. Those that it can't control, it isolates. @kevinredifer @oikeios @atomicapproach @BizarrelyCoca It specifically *made* EU dependence on Russian gas "backfire." Or did you not take Biden seriously when he specifically said "There will be no longer a Nord Stream 2, we will bring an end to it"?
