# valence electrons

@TARYNxOFFICIAL Tweet length explanation:

Chemicals react with each other using "valence electrons," which like to be in pairs. Free radicals only have one, so they tear things apart trying to get another--things like the insides of your cells. Antioxidants calm them with a second electron. @TARYNxOFFICIAL Side note: your body actually produces its own antioxidants, and the stuff you consume doesn't have any evidence of those antioxidants actually making it to the insides of your cells before your stomach breaks them down.
