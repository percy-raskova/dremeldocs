# anticapitalist-themed capitalism

Leaving aside the valid critiques of "anticapitalist-themed capitalism," and gentrification, there is another problem exemplified here. There is a belief (especially prominent among anarchists) that independently doing random shit will somehow bring about a "revolution."i https://t.co/VnVkxJEX21 I get it. It's frustrating to feel like there's nothing that *you*, personally can do. You just want to do *something*. But there are productive things you can do.

Chief among them is labor organizing, especially spreading revolutionary politics among your coworkers.
