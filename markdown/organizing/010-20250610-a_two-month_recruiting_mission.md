# a two-month recruiting mission

I am currently away from home on a two-month recruiting mission, but when I return to Baltimore, we will have a powerful ally and be ready to begin our revolutionary organizing in earnest. (The "recruiting mission" is actually just spending time with my amazing partner before she moves back to Baltimore with me.)
