# @keepaustinnasty We should also be aware that, no matter...

@keepaustinnasty We should also be aware that, no matter how intentional we are, stuff can still happen beyond our control. Fall and break a hip at 70, contract a novel virus that gives you chronic fatigue at 30 -- the key is to mitigate as many opportunities for failure as possible. @keepaustinnasty If I had exercised more before becoming disabled, it wouldn't have prevented *this* outcome. But it still would have helped in other ways. Wearing a seatbelt doesn't help if someone plants a car bomb, but you should still fucking do it.
