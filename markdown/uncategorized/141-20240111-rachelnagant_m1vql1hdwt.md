# @RachelNagant @m1vql1hdwt

@RachelNagant @m1vql1hdwt Yeah, I was aware these guys believed that. But clearly he wasn't the Mashiach Ben Yoseph, who would rebuild the temple and fight and die in a holy war, after which the messianic age can begin under the reign of the Mashiach Ben David. @RachelNagant @m1vql1hdwt So they theoretically "should" believe that the modern state of Israel is an abomination, because God has not yet given his blessing to rebuild Eretz Yisrael, for we are still "impure."
