# a biological father

@itsmehaleyyyyy I would guess that the reason people *assume* that is because pregnancy and nursing takes a lot of time, during which a biological father could "accumulate" several offspring with other mates, such as in lions.

However, that's simply NOT the reproductive strategy of hominids ðŸ¤¦ @itsmehaleyyyyy In fact, the main reason humans have been so ludicrously successful in evolutionary terms is because of our complex social networks. We spent hundreds of thousands of years developing technology because ALL adults participated in child-rearing. Including grandparents!
