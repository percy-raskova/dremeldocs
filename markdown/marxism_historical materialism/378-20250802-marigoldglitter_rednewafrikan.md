# @marigoldglitter @rednewafrikan

@marigoldglitter @rednewafrikan This is what I was actually alluding toward, but I decided to be glib instead. @marigoldglitter @rednewafrikan "The bedrock of social alienation" in our society is the bourgeois family form. That includes all its outgrowths -- its norms and mores, its prescriptions of gender and sexuality and relationship models and childrearing and housing arrangements and elders and on and on.
