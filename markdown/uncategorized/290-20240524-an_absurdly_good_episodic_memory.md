# an absurdly good episodic memory

I have an absurdly good episodic memory and an astonishingly terrible working memory. I can conjure up experiences I had when I was 4 on a whim, but I also have about 576 things I've been "meaning to do," and I'm 5-15 minutes late to work every single day. Anyway, my point is that yes, someone *does* remember that really embarrassing, awkward thing you did that one time. Sorry.
