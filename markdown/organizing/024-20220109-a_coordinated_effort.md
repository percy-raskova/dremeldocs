# a coordinated effort

@audmar @Lakshmi_RKG If you have kid(s) in school, talk to other parents and put together a coordinated effort like all sending a flurry of emails to the school board at once or all speaking at board meetings. Try to get in touch with the union to see how you can help put pressure. @audmar @Lakshmi_RKG If you can get enough parents in the same school (and ideally other schools) to commit, you could do a student sickout, where you pick a day to all keep your kids home for the day.
