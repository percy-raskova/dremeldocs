# s really more shibboleth than it is rigorous terminology --...

@FoxyMarxist Right. It's really more shibboleth than it is rigorous terminology -- and it's one the chauvinists seem absolutely determined to fail. The point of saying "settler-colonialism is the primary contradiction" is to point out what exactly we need to be focused on in our investigation @FoxyMarxist The Big Enemy we are facing is completely inscrutable -- and therefore impossible to defeat -- without FIRST starting from the position of "The US is a settler colonial empire, whose very existence is a manifestation of oppression. The empire must be destroyed." @FoxyMarxist The "Communist" Party of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA cannot integrate this very foundational concept into its ethos, because it is first and foremost a Yankee party. Which is exactly why it has failed at every step for over a century.
