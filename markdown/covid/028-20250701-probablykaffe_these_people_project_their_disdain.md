@probablykaffe These people project their disdain for the most oppressed onto us, assuming that we MUST also have those biases deep in our guts. They ascribe our politics to us actively repressing those urges and overcorrecting in favor of fetishistic fascination. @probablykaffe Any pro-lumpen attitude MUST be a performance, because who could *identify with* these dregs?

For all I know, maybe there ARE people like that in our sphere. Or maybe people who started out that way and grew out of it. I honestly don't care, as long as they Follow the Leader.
