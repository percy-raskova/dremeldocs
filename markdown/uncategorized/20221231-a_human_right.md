# a human right

In Cuba, food is a human right. You are guaranteed 100% of your daily nutritional needs, for absolutely no cost. If you want more variety, there is other food available for sale at heavily-subsidized prices - a lower percentage of your income than Americans spend. https://t.co/eyILioWDKQ Due to the internationally-condemned U.S. embargo, obviously options are limited. The grocery stores aren't overflowing with a gluttonous orgy of 40 types of Oreos, but... there are cookies.

If you're in a privileged social position in the U.S., yeah, it would be a step down. Personally, I'd rather live in a society where everyone is fed and housed, rather than one in which I have my pick among 100 different brands of toothpaste (that are all made by the same 3 corporations anyway).
