# any comprehensive texts

@fiercefurry I'm not sure of any comprehensive texts, since I like to look at individual events and study a variety of sources describing them.

A good example is the difference in the US' attitude towards movements in Japan vs. Korea and Vietnam. Or German Social Democrats vs. Communists. @fiercefurry Basically every involvement of the US/Europe in the middle east from WWII to today.

The propping up of dictators in South/Central America.

Liberation movements all over Africa (Burkina Faso, Angola)
