# Y'all really need to learn the difference between critique...

Y'all really need to learn the difference between critique and bad faith shit-stirring.

Especially if we have an eye toward labor militancy and outright revolution. We WILL need to take actions that end up affecting ordinary people's comfort and well-being. "Seize the means of production" is not just a slogan. It is a description of the necessary reorganization of production and distribution into the hands of the working class. Capital will not simply concede these things to us. They will use violence--both physical and economic. This necessarily impacts innocent people. It will harm the most vulnerable first, for whom the system already says "Pay us or suffer." Capitalism is the culprit. It has replaced social support with market "solutions," gatekept by whether profit can be extracted from the service. Anyone who--for example--relies on delivery services to get groceries, is someone who will be *best* served by a non-market economy. They are also the first to have their tenuous privileges taken away when capitalists fight back. And communists need to be able to ensure support. This extends to all sectors of society, not just support for disabled comrades. The more we attempt to reclaim from capital, the more it will attempt to deprive us. We need to be able to provide food, water, homes, medicine, security, education, and much more. Until we are victorious, and control all production, we will never be able to provide *everything* for each other. Hence, we also need to inoculate our communities against the mind games capital will play. We need to equip communities to assess their real needs. And yes, in the course of a capitalist reaction to revolution, living standards will likely decline. We may have to go without GrubHub.

It's the job of communists to ensure that as much as possible, needs are met, lives are preserved, and sacrifices are made willingly. It would be easy for me to say "If you can drive to a grocery store to berate a worker, you can get your own damn groceries."

It's more *correct* to say "The time is now to build the mass line."

What do we need? What can we do without? The answers come from taking action.
