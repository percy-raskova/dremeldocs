# @KirbyHonest It fits *better*, although we did see plenty...

@KirbyHonest It fits *better*, although we did see plenty of that obsession in BB. And tbh, it still feels a little out of character that he wouldn't even consider that it could be a trap. We never got any indication that there was ever a danger of Hector going to the feds. @KirbyHonest That is, why would the idea that Hector went to the DEA make Gus so rattled that he'd get that reckless? How could he think that was even a possibility? Why would he decide that *that* was the moment he had to kill him, even after he'd said he was keeping him alive for revenge?
