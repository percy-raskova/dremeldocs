# t help but feel like the appearance of 

Can't help but feel like the appearance of "rotting" as a cutesy vernacular term for laying around is a direct consequence of an increasing mass of people becoming disabled by COVID and not having the vocabulary for it, or even awareness that that's the culprit. It's not "chronic fatigue brought on as a consequence of exposure to a novel, multisystemic virus implicated in autoimmunity, neurological damage, cardiopulmonary disease, and mitochondrial dysfunction."

It's simply a euphemistic, Victorian-style, inexplicable "wasting away."
