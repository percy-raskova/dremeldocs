# On September 11th, 2001, I raised my hand to ask to go to...

On September 11th, 2001, I raised my hand to ask to go to the bathroom. The teacher said no. It was my first month of elementary school, and I didn't realize the answer could possibly be no.

I pissed my pants.

Then my dad took me home, and I saw something scary happening on TV. https://t.co/iOoUF5WZAT "Aren't you embarrassed to post about pissing your pants?"

No, because I am no longer 6 years old, and it is objectively hilarious that I was literally peeing myself during 9/11.
