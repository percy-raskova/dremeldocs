# so much time

I wasted so much time being a liberal. 10 years ago, I absolutely could have understood Marxism at almost the level I do today. I could have skipped my social democrat phase. Baltimore could have had a workers' council by now.

Educating the masses is so important. To be clear, I'm not saying a 17-year-old me could have single-handedly built a soviet. I'm saying if there had been an active contingent of actual Marxists doing real political education in the area, I and MANY others could have skipped liberalism and built something real.
