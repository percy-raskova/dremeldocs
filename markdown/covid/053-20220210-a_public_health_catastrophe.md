# a public health catastrophe

I hope people grasp that the goal in taking mask mandates off the table--even in places where they are readily accepted--is explicitly about inuring us to the concept of a public health catastrophe. That's what they mean by "mental health," and "trusting public health officials." Masks are a visual reminder that we are in the middle of a pandemic. As long as they have thay staring them in the face, people will never stop demanding support from the government. That means guaranteed sick leave, which means businesses occasionally closing temporarily.
