# This complete misunderstanding

This complete misunderstanding is why I keep harping on the fact that national oppression is the PRIMARY contradiction of settler colonies. Class consciousness is precluded by the colonial relation -- which is the ENTIRE PURPOSE of the colony -- reinforcing material disparity. https://t.co/w8IE0E2WOs Colonies are not built for shits and giggles. They are not maintained by bad vibes. They are an engine of hyper-exploitation and continual reproduction of bourgeois hegemony. As long as the "Israeli proletariat" continues to see themselves as "Israeli," they uphold the project. "Workers of the world unite" is a slogan mindlessly parroted by those particular workers advantaged by a global arrangement designed to make them feel like their standard of living -- propped up by blood and steel -- is typical, natural, and immutable. There is a fundamental disconnect between the idealistic imaginings of those in the nations crafted to oppress and the drive for liberation by those nations ascribed oppression. We "workers" cannot "unite" under any other banner but the destruction of the oppressor nation.
