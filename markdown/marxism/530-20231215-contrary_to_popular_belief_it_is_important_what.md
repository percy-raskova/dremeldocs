# Contrary to popular belief, it IS important what books...

Contrary to popular belief, it IS important what books you've read and what label you use. "Filling a room" is not sufficient. Democrats can fill a room. Republicans can fill a room. Taylor Swift can fill a room. What matters is filling a room with people who are there to fulfill a mission. Which means they need to have clarity about what that mission entails, as well as motivation to fulfill it. Which means YOU need that clarity and that motivation. That's what reading and labels do. You cannot attract people to your cause if you have no clue what that cause is or how to go about accomplishing it. You don't have to know everything about everything, but you need to know enough to start deliberately seeking out more specific answers and helping others do so. Luckily for you, you don't have to start from scratch. We have hundreds of years of history to draw on: the many, many findings of our revolutionary forebears. They were kind enough to write down everything they observed, all their experiments, all their theories. All for us! ðŸ¥° The disgust at reading "dusty old tomes" is a product of the same liberal hegemony that has held back all progress here for a century. They want you cut off from the past. They want you to believe that every victory was a colossal failure, that you can trust no one but yourself. We need to be bold. We need to learn from each other. We need to know who our enemies and who our allies are -- including historically.

Most of all, we need to be able to convey that clarity to those who also demand change. That's how you fill a room as a communist.
