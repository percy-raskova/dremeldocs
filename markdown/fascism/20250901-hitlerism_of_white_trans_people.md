# Hitlerism of white trans people

This perennial sentiment around the supposed "Hitlerism of white trans people" is pretty fucking transparent. It's demonstrably untrue that trans people are more likely to be racist or pro-empire or "had a Nazi phase" or whatever the fuck you're using to launder your distaste. Are there trans Nazis? Obviously. There are also black Nazis -- that doesn't mean there's any link there whatsoever. Those are counter-examples.

In fact, out of every subpopulation of white people, trans people are the least likely BY FAR to be fascists. Even the very premise of the "concern" rests on a fundamental skewing of who trans people are. The perception of trans people as disproportionately white, wealthy, landed gentry with fancy tech jobs and a vested interest in the well-being of empire is completely backwards. There is no "just asking questions" on this matter. It's an open and shut case, and the only reason to reopen it is to wedge your chauvinism in like a crowbar and pry it open. You're not slick.
