# Hamas is willing to work with communists to achieve...

Hamas is willing to work with communists to achieve liberation. That's why communists like the PFLP are willing to work with Hamas to achieve liberation. It's really that simple. As communists, who are our enemies? Those who would rather fight against us than alongside us against our shared oppressor. If they see communism as an equivalent or even greater threat, then they have made *themselves* an enemy of communists.
