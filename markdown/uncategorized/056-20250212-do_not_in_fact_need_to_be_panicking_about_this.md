# do not , in fact , need to be panicking about this 

You do not, in fact, need to be panicking about this.

Considering the size and speed, this is the equivalent of a 2% chance that a single, small nuclear bomb will be detonated somewhere on the planet -- an event that has occurred literally thousands of times. https://t.co/tJrDgnGP1d There is a very, very, VERY small chance of this both hitting the Earth at all, AND hitting a population center.

Treat this like scientists predicting a 2% chance of a large earthquake happening somewhere on earth a decade from now.
