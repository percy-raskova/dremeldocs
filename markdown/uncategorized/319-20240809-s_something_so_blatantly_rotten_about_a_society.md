There's something so blatantly rotten about a society that atomizes its subjects so severely that it's considered the *exception* when you finally experience friendships that go deeper than "people I enjoy spending time with." https://t.co/VAFc1URfyj The best description of "platonic partner" is "the kind of best friend you would have in a society that doesn't suck you dry and deliberately cleave you from all the bonds of community."

You deserve to love your friends. Deeply, intimately, without reservation.
